            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>There are two things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Firſt, a fitting and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the ſoule for Chriſt. Secondly, an inplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18422:3"/>
of the Soule into Chriſt. For howſoever it is true there is aboundance of mercy, and infinite merit in Chriſt: yet unleſſe the Soule be fitted and enabled by the hand of faith, to lay hold upon Chriſt; he ſhall never receive comfort from him, be his neceſſities never ſo many, and his miſery never ſo grievous. Therefore <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was ſent to prepare the way, that all thoſe mountaines of pride might be laid low, and all the ditches filled up, and all the crooked things might be made ſtrieght and all rough things might be made ſmooth, that there might be a way for Chriſt. The meaning is this: The heart of a man is the high way wherein Chriſt comes. Now there are mountaines of pride and untoward ſtoutneſſe of heart, and many windings and turnings, and devices which the heart hath, by reaſon of many luſts that are in it. This fitting and preparing, is nothing elſe but the taking away of that knotty knarlineſſe of the heart, and that pride, and all ſuch curſed corruptions, that the doore may be ſet open, and the heart made ready that the King of glory may come in.</p>
            <p>The heart being thus fitted and enabled, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes humiliation: for the breaking of the heart, is not all that God hath to doe with a poore ſinner, though the Lord wound the heart of a ſinner, and run him through, yet the heart will be ſtarting aſide, and will not goe out to Chriſt. Therefore I ſhall now ſpeake of humiliation of the ſpirit, yet before I come to it, give me leave to lay open two paſſages.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The neceſſity of this worke, it muſt needs be.</item>
               <item>2. The nature of this worke.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:18422:3"/>Firſt, it is neceſſary that the ſoule ſhould be thus humbled; for humiliation pares away all ſelfe-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency from the ſoule by compunction: the Lord breakes the heart, and wearies it with ſinne, and then the ſoule will be no more drunke, nor looſe, nor vaine, no more fooliſh, nor diſſembling, nor hating of Gods ſervants, nor uſe no more falſe weights; by humiliation the Lord plucks away the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a mans priviledges, and all his good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and all his duties, by which he is ready to ſhelter himſelfe, and by which he thinks to get ſome ſuccour and comfort to his owne ſoule. Now as ſinne ſhall not rule in the heart, ſo the Lord will make the ſinner ſee, that whatſoever he hath and doth, can never helpe him, except the Lord Ieſus come downe from heaven by his mightie power. For the further opening of theſe, you muſt know that there are theſe two maine lets, which hinder the comming of faith into the ſoule, and which keepe a man from beleeving in Chriſt, that Chriſt may have poſſeſſion of him.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Let of Faith.</note> when the ſoule is taken up with a ſecure courſe, and reſts it ſelfe well apaide in his owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and therefore it never ſeeth any need of a change, nor never goes out for a change: now while he lives thus, and bleſſeth himſelfe in his ſinne, it is impoſſible that ever the ſoule ſhould receive faith, or ever by the power of faith repaire to Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe termes: for ever where faith comes it works a change, all the old things are done away, and become new, he is new in heart and life; now the ſecure ſinner that ſeeth no need of a change, will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18422:4"/>
never ſee need of faith, nor labour for it; and if the Miniſters of God bid ſuch a man to leave his ſinne, and to pray in his family, and forſake his ſinfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and to ſanctifie the Lords day, and take up new courſes, he thinkes they bid him to his loſſe: now by that time the Lord hath taken away this let, and burthened the ſoule marvellous extreamely, and ſaith, is it well that you live in drunkenneſſe, and in covetouſneſſe, in cheating, in lying and the like, then take your ſinnes and get you downe to hell with them; thus the Lord is forced to breake the heart: then a poore ſinner begins to ſee where he is, and now he ſaith, and is this true, then I am the moſt miſerable creature under heaven, and except I be otherwiſe, it had beene good for mee if I had never beene borne; by this time the ſoule ſees need of a change: Therefore as they ſaid, <hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we doe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> we have beene thus and thus, but if we reſt here it will be our ruine for ever, oh what ſhall we doe. Thus the ſoule comes to a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſlike of it ſelfe, and ſaith, I muſt either be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe or elſe I am but a damned man for ever.</p>
            <p>When the ſoule is thus reſolved that it muſt of neceſſitie change, and there is no dallying with the Lord nor with himſelfe, and this heart muſt be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and this courſe muſt be amended. When it ſees that it muſt change, it begins to improve all meanes to ſee if he can poſſibly doe it by his owne ſtrength, and by his meanes uſing, as if the ſoule did ſay, good Lord cannot my wit compaſſe it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not my prayers worke it, and though I am a ſinfull wretched man, yet I will be no more drunke, nor
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18422:4"/>
uncleane, nor the like: but by prayer, and hearing, and faſting, I will labour to mend all in this kinde; will not theſe duties doe the deed? this very reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a mans ſelfe-ſufficiency doth marveilouſly croſſe and hinder the worke of Faith, for this is the nature of Faith; It goes out of it ſelfe, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a principle of life, grace, and power from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſoule apprehends it ſelfe miſerable, and it falls upon the arme of Gods mercy, and meerely goes out to God for ſuccour. Now for a man to fetch all from without, and yet to ſeeke for ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency from himſelfe, theſe two cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are profeſſely croſſe one to another; and therefore after the Lord hath made the ſoule ſee an abſolute neceſſitie of a change, and now the ſoule ſeeth an utter impoſſibilitie in himſelfe, to change or alter himſelfe, then he is content to goe to Chriſt for grace and power. Thus Humiliation pares away all a mans priviledges and all his hearing and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. not, that a man muſt uſe theſe noe more, but he muſt not reſt upon them for ſtrength to help and ſuccour himſelfe withall. as it is with the graft. 1. it muſt be cut of from the old ſtocke 2. it muſt be pared and made fit for the implantation into an other. Soe the Soule being cut of from ſinne: then humiliation pares it, and makes it for the ingrafting into Chriſt.<note place="margin">What humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is.</note> thus you ſee this worke is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But what is this humiliation of heart. It is thus much. When the ſoule upon ſearch made deſpaires of all helpe from it ſelfe: he doth not deſpaire of Gods mercy, but of all helpe from himſelfe and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18422:5"/>
ſubmits himſelfe wholy to God, the ſoule ſtrikes ſale and fals under the power of Ieſus Chriſt and is content to be at his diſpoſing,</p>
            <p>In this deſcription let me diſcover theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular paſſages.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the ſinner that is now wounded and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of his owne miſery, makes out for ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and remedy els where, but he doth not goe to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly when he uſed all meanes that he can, he ſeeth noe helpe at all, nay, he utterly deſpaires of finding any ſuccour from himſelfe or from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Then the ſoule deſpairing of all ſuccour in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it fals downe at the throne of grace, and ſaith, if the Lord will damne him he may, and if he will ſave him he may which as yet he cannot ſee, but he reſolves to waite upon God for mercy; he ſubmits himſelfe to the Lord and is content to bee at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing.</p>
            <p>For the firſt part of the deſcription that the ſoule ſeeketh for remedy els where and not from Chriſt. this is expreſt here in the 15 verſe of this Chapter. The Prodigall would needs have his portion, and hee would not ever bee a ſlave in his fathers family: well he had his portion and gone he is, and he hath ſpent all, and when all was gone there fell a great famine in the Lande; and, what did he then? hee would not now ryot any more as he had done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe poverty pinched him in this kind, but he turnes good huſband. and is content to uſe any meanes for his maintenance, and hee would make hard ſhift
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18422:5"/>
before he would goe home to his father, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he joynes himſelfe to a Cittizen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This prodigall is a true picture of every poore diſtreſſed ſinner that hath ryotted away his time, yet at laſt when the venome of ſinne beginnes to ſcorch and pearce his ſoule, and he is famiſhed for want of Gods favour and the wrath of God purſues him, and a deſperate ſorrow ſeaſeth upon his heart, and he is wearied and burthened and tired with his ſinne, and ſees that hee hath noe helpe, hee ſets all his wits to worke to ſee if hee can tell which way to ſuccour himſelfe in theſe his grievances, and though he will not take up any baſe courſes as hee had done, but prooves a good huſband and uſeth all meanes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour himſelfe. ſoe the doctrine from hence is this.</p>
            <div n="1" type="doctrine">
               <head>Doctrine.</head>
               <p>A ſinner naturally in his trouble and diſtreſſe ſeekes for ſuccour (not from God nor from Chriſt) but from himſelfe and from his owne abilities.</p>
               <p>Soe that the ſoule being in this great extremity of heart by reaſon of his ſinne, he dares not, nay hee will not meddle with ſinne any more but it betakes it ſelf to hearing and praying, and to other duties or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary, and by theſe he thinkes to be abſolutely ſuccoured. I confes the beſt of Gods Saints muſt uſe theſe meanes, they muſt heare and pray, and faſt, but they muſt not reſt upon theſe; it was very fit that the Prodigall ſhould labour for his living, but not that he ſhould not withall ſeeke home to his father for reliefe.

naturally to make of meanes a Saviour to himſelfe: he ſcrapes for ſome ſuccour and, and reſts upon ſome rotten endeavours, and becauſe he can heare and pray and faſt, he thinks this is enough to ſave him, he uſes not theſe to bring him to Chriſt but reſts on them.</p>
               <p>It is a naturall thing ingrafted into all mankind ſince the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> as you may ſee by the Apoſtle;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.31.32.</note> becauſe the Iewes were ſcrambling for life and happineſſe from the workes of the Law, therefore they could not attaine it, but the Gentiles which did not ſeeke it from the workes of the Law, they got it. as if he had ſaid, when they ſaw their anguiſh and trouble then they fell upon theſe duties of hearing and praying and faſting, and they thought that was enough in Conſcience, and here they tooke up their ſtand, this is to cleave to a man of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> and the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, they being ignorant of the rightouſnes of God, ſought to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their owne righteouſneſſe, &amp;c: this they would have, here they would reſt, and here they would die. In common experience wee may ſee it: take a poore ſinner that hath been ſoundly awakened in the ſence of his owne vileneſſe, what is the ground of his hope? Oh ſaith hee, now the world is well amended with mee, and I have not beene drunke ſo many yeeres, and I have performed theſe and theſe duties, as if that would ſerve the turne: this is to looke for happineſſe from a mans owne duties. It is with a poore ſinner as it was with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaw his wound and his ſickneſſe,<note place="margin">Hoſea 5.13.</note> then hee went to <hi>Aſhur</hi> and to king <hi>Iaribbe,</hi> that is to the king of contention or advocate, but hee did not heale
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18422:6"/>
their wound. Therefore the lamenting Church ſaith <hi>Aſhur</hi> ſhall not ſave us,<note place="margin">Hoſea 14.1.</note> we will not ride upon horſes neither will wee ſay any more to the worke of our hands, yow are our gods: as if they had ſaid, wee made king <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and the King of Aegypt our gods, and wee thought wee might have hired helpe from them; but now wee ſee there is no helpe in them: as it was in that temporall diſtreſſe, ſo it is in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affliction of the ſoule. When the ſoule ſeeth his wound and his ſinne before him to condemne him, and miſery prepared to plague him, and he hath (as it were) a little peepe-hole into hell, the ſoule in this diſtreſſe ſends over to prayer and hearing and holy ſervices, and thinkes by his wits and duties or ſome ſuch like matters to ſuccour it ſelfe, and it begins to ſay my hearing and my prayer, &amp;c. will not theſe ſave me? thus the ſoule in concluſion reſts in their duties. Though theſe duties be all good, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and comfortable, yet they are no gods at all able of themſelves to ſave us, but they are the ordinances of God that leade us to God, yet they cannot give ſalvation to any that reſts upon them. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a ſinfull heart to make the meanes as merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to ſalvation; yet miſtake me not, theſe duties muſt be had and uſed, but ſtill a man muſt not ſtay here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man will uſe his bucket, but he expects wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the well: theſe meanes are the buckets, but all our comfort, and all our life and grace is onely in Chriſt; if you ſay your bucket ſhall helpe you, you may ſtarve for thirſt if you let it not downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the well for water: ſo, though you brag of your praying, and hearing, and faſting, and of your almes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18422:7"/>
and building of hoſpitals and your good deeds, if none of theſe bring you to a Chriſt, and if theſe are not meanes to ſettle you on a Chriſt, you ſhall die for thirſt, though your works were as the works of an Angel.</p>
               <p>But why doth the ſoule ſeeke for ſuccour from it ſelfe, and will not goe out to Chriſt?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> The firſt reaſon is, becauſe the ſinner (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not yet to be in Chriſt) out of the guilt of ſin dares not be ſo proud as to thinke that he ſhall have any favour at Gods hands, for the ſinner being now overwhelmed with the body of death and the guilt of his abominations galling of him, and being ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by reaſon of his ſinnes, and ſtill his ſinnes being before his eyes, and to this day having gotten no aſſurance of the pardon of them, and God being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry againſt him, his heart ſhrinkes in conſideration of the eternall wrath of the Almighty againſt him; and he ſaith, becauſe I have deſpiſed juſtice and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercy, how dare I appeare before Gods juſtice; for feare juſtice conſume me and execute vengeance upon me, and therefore the ſoule dares not yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come before God: and hence it is that the ſoule ſaith, can I not take ſome courſe of my ſelfe and doe it without Chriſt? muſt I needs goe and heare? certainly the word will condemne: and muſt I needs goe and confeſſe my ſinnes? what ſhall I a rebell goe before a Prince? to come before him, it is the next way to be executed and have ſome plague throwne upon me. As a malefactor will deviſe ſome ſhift that hee may not come before the judge; ſo while the ſoul may have ſome ſuccour from himſelf
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18422:7"/>
and the ſtaffe is in his owne hand there is ſome hope, and he would willingly doe any thing for himſelfe; but for the ſoule to have ſalvation out of his owne reach, and to put the ſtaffe out of his owne hand and to hang his ſalvation upon Gods good pleaſure, whoſe love and mercy (as yet) he was never perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of. Oh this is very hard, and the heart is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſhie and carefull in this; and it is with the heart in this kinde as <hi>Rabſhecah</hi> ſaid to the people of Iſrael; <hi>If you ſay to mee,</hi>

                  <hi>is not that hee whoſe altars you have broken downe,</hi> &amp;c. Thus hee laboured to plucke away the hearts of this people from truſting in the Lord: The ſoule in this kinde ſometimes ſhakes and ſhrinkes in the apprehenſion of his owne vilenes, and ſaith as this wretch did, have you offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him? and doe you looke for any ſuccour from him? this argument was very peeviſh and keene and yet falſe, for they were the altars of Idols, but the ſoule ſaith againſt it ſelfe and marvellous truly: when a Miniſter would perſwade a man to goe to heaven for mercy, the ſoule begins to reaſon thus with it ſelfe, and ſaith, ſhall I repaire to God? Oh thats my trouble, is not he that great God whoſe juſtice, and mercy, and patience I have abuſed? and is not he the great God of heaven and earth, that hath beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt mee? oh, with what face can I appeare before him, and with what heart can I looke for any mercy from him; I have wronged his juſtice, and can his juſtice pardon mee?

have refuſed that mercy, and have trampled the blood of Chriſt under my feet; and can I looke for any mercy? no, no, I ſee the wrath of the Lord incenſed againſt mee, and thats all that I looke for: the ſoule rather deſires the mountaines to fall upon him, that he may never appeare before God. Nay, I have obſerved this in experience. In the horror of heart, the ſoule dare ſcarce reade the Word of God, for feare he ſhould reade his owne necke verſe, and he dare not pray, for feare his prayers be turned into ſinne, and ſo increaſe his Iudgement: thus the ſoule out of the guilt of ſinne dare not ſeeke out to the Lord, and therefore it will uſe any ſhift to helpe it ſelfe without going to God.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> The ſecond Reaſon, why the ſoule dare not ſeeke out to Chriſt for ſuccour, it is this, becauſe the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of life and ſalvation through Chriſt are not yet made knowne to the ſoule, the ſoule being yet conſidered, as barely broken and wearied with the burthen of ſinne. Let me ſay as the Apoſtle doth, the new and living way in Chriſt, is not yet revealed to the ſoule, and it is not yet ſet open before his eyes, though it ſhall be revealed, taking it as in this preciſe conſideration only prepared for Chriſt. Nay, thoſe ſupernaturall truthes, namely, that the ſoule muſt live by another mans life, and be made holy by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers holineſſe, and be ſanctified by anothers ſpirit, theſe are not yet revealed; theſe doe exceed our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature. <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall could not have found out this way, if the Lord had not revealed it.

And it is with every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man as it was with <hi>Sampſon:</hi> he had once Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall haire, and therefore when any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came, hee did ſhake himſelfe, and was able to breake ſtrong cords, and to overcome his enemies, and when his haire was gone, hee went out as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, and thought to doe as he had done, but the Spirit of God was gone from him: So, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had power of himſelfe to yield exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and to pleaſe God, a naturall man makes an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of this ſtill, and would be doing, and he goes out and ſhakes himſelfe, and ſaith, cannot my wit, and

my prayers, and my good meanings, and my privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſave mee, and ſatisfie divine Iuſtice, muſt the guilt of ſinne ſtill lye upon mee. Thus the ſoule would give content to God by his owne ſtrength; as it is with a man that hath beene a rich Chapman, and hath had a faire ſtocke, but is now decayed, it is hard to bring downe the pride of this mans heart, he is loath to be a Iourney-man againe, he will be trading though it be but for pinnes: So, the Lord put a ſtocke into <hi>Adams</hi> hand, and hee turned bankrupt; and yet wee will be trading here for a company of poore beggerly duties, dead prayers, and cold hearings, and we thinke this will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. This is the diſpoſition of the ſoule naturally: So, the iſſue of the point is thus much; if the ſoule through the guilt of ſinne dare not appeare before God, and it knowes not yet how to come to God, in, and through a Mediator; and in regard of <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, it needed not to goe out to another, for any power and ſtrength, hence it is that the ſoule will invent any way, and take up any courſe rather then come to Chriſt, but all the former truthes are true, and therefore ſtill this turnes the heart to deale with God in this manner.</p>

If hee come home never ſo late, the Lord receives him when he comes.

When the ſoule lyes under the hand of God, and under his ſtroke, and a man ſeeth his drunkenneſſe, and his baſe contempt of God, and his grace, and all his ſinnes are preſented before him?

Its true, this is the way, and theſe are the very meanes, but all theſe cannot procure the pardon of one ſinne, if he goe no further. We have many ſuch trials: I have knowne many that have done great works, but never had a thought of Chriſt, and never expected ſalvation from him, and thus they fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the huskes: and when the divell ſaith, you pray, and heare, and doe duties; ſo did <hi>Iudas</hi> and many others that are now in hell, then the heart ſeeth his vileneſſe, and he is driven to a deſperate deſpaire, ſo that no Miniſter under heaven is able to comfort him, but he goes away with the huske of duties, but Chriſt who is the ſubſtance of all, and the pithe of a promiſe is forgotten, and a Chriſt in hearing, and a Chriſt in prayer is not regarded, and therefore he famiſheth for hunger.</p>

It is true, this Text main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aimes at a temporall deliverance, but this may draw us to conſider the ſucceſſe that a poore Soule finds in his duties, reſting upon them. When a poore Soule is broken in the ſight of his ſinne, and weary of it; he ſends downe to praier, and hearing, and the like; but theſe cannot ſuccour him without Chriſt:<note place="margin">Eſay 55.2.</note> and therefore the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why lay you out your money for that which is not bread, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord accounts the paines of his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants good labour, and would not have them lay it out for that which is not bread. All the profits that may inrich a man, and all the honours that may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a man; nay, all the priviledges that a man hath; as Word, Sacraments, and Ordinances; and that a man is baptized, and hath often come to the Lords Table; theſe come no farther then the very bare huske; if they goe no farther, and have not an eie to their Saviour; theſe are no true bread: the horror of heart cannot bee quieted, nor his ſinnes pardoned, barely by theſe duties doing: the meate of the Soule, is not the bare Word, nor the bare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18422:12"/>
but a Chriſt in all theſe: this is the prop of the Soule: all the bare duties in the world cannot ſuccour us, if we reſt upon them, without juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> a learned Phariſee,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.5, 6, 7.</note> and a man of an unblameable life, becauſe hee was a man of a good life, of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and a Iew cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed the eighth day; hee thought to doe great matters, and hee thought he had done enough; hee counted theſe his priviledges, gaine.

Thus you ſee that a diſtreſſed ſinner finds himſelfe helpleſſe, and hopeleſſe, in regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſufficient ſuccour in himſelfe, or the creature, if he goe no further then the very duty.</p>
               <p>Now the Soule finds that there is no ſaving ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to be had in theſe duties barely: I ſay, he comes to ſee it by theſe three meanes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, from his owne experience that forceth him to confeſſe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from the examples of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The greatneſſe of the evill that lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, makes him ſee an utter inabilitie to receive any good from that which he doth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From his owne experience. Though hee thought to take up a new courſe, and to performe holy duties, and thought that without all queſtion theſe would ſave him, yet hee finds now that theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18422:13"/>
will not doe the deed, hee hath no ſaving good in theſe; and that appeares by theſe three particulars. Firſt, He ſeeth that the guilt of ſinne ſtill remaines, and the juſtice of God, being unſatisfied ſtill purſues him, though he pray, and heare, and performe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties, as the Lord told the people, when they were ſharking for their owne comfort, and they thought to give God content by their new courſes. Yet the Lord tells them, <hi>Though thou waſh thee with Nitre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 2.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and take thee much ſope, and though thou uſe all meanes of reformation, yet thy ſinnes are ſealed up, and thy iniquitie is marked before mee.</hi> It is with a poore ſinner as the Pſalmiſt ſaith of himſelfe; <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>or whither ſhall I flie from thy preſence, if I aſcend up into heaven thou art there, if I lye downe in hell thou art there, if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, even thither ſhall thy right hand leade mee, &amp;c.</hi> So, let a poore ſinner goe where he will, and do what he can, the guilt of ſinne will ever be with him, it will lye downe, and riſe up, and walke with him in the way. His ſinnes remaine unpardoned, and the wrath of God is not appeaſed: and hence it is that all his prayers, are but as ſo many inditements againſt him, and he dare not reade the word for feare hee ſhould reade his owne damnation. Nay, at every Sermon that he heares, he ſeeth more vileneſſe in himſelfe, and every Sacrament that hee receives, increaſeth (not his comfort but) his horror, and he thinks thus with himſelf, good Lord, I have taken my bane this day for I come unpreparedly, and the Lord knowes, what an unfaithfull, and unbelieving heart I have.</p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:18422:13"/>Secondly, as the guilt of ſinne cannot be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved   by all his duties, ſo his conſcience cannot be quieted by all that he doth; if his heart be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pierced by the Sword of the Law, ſtill conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence calles upon him, and quarrels with him, and takes exceptions againſt him in the beſt of his duties, ſo farre they are from yielding any ſatisfaction to God, or from bringing any peace to his conſcience; if hee reſt upon the bare performance of them. I ſpeake of a broken hearted ſinner: for the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is now Eagle eyed, it was full of filme, and ſcales before, but now it is open, and Eagle eyed, and can ſpie, all his weakeneſſes, and picke matter of diſquiet, even in the beſt of all his duties that are done. The Soule thought them very good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet now the heart is touched, and conſcience is awakened, and tells him of his barrenneſſe, and deadneſſe, and roaving thoughts, when hee doth pray, and how inſufficient, he is to pray, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dare not pray with his Family, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſaith to him, you have formerly contemned prayer: and now you cannot pray. And when the Soule comes into the congregation, there Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence notes him, and when he goes home, Conſcience ſaith thus unto him, how dead were you, and how unreverently did you attend to the Word, and how unwilling was your heart to be in ſubjection to the Word, thus Conſcience becomes Gods Serjeant, and ſaith, doeſt thou thinke that theſe prayers will ſave thee; Nay, they are rather a meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee, ſo heartleſſe, ſo cold, and ſo dead hearted thou art in them; and is this hearing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18422:14"/>
to ſave thee: Nay, will not the Lord curſe thee for thy weake performance of theſe duties? Now the diſtreſſed Soule comes to a ſtand with it ſelfe, and he ſeeth ſo much weakenes in his duties, that he almoſt leaves off all, ſaying: I had as good not goe to the Word at all, for I profit not by it; and I had as good not pray at all, as pray thus deadly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly: thus the Lord drives the Soule out of himſelfe; and when Conſcience thus picks quarrels with him, and ſaith; Will prayer, and hearing, and theſe duties ſo meanely performed, ſave you? Nay, may not God juſtly confound you for them? It is admirable mercy that God did not confound you in hearing, and ſtrike you dead in praying! and then Conſcience calls him in queſtion for his old ſinnes, and ſaith; If God may condemne thee for theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for theſe praiers? Then what may God doe for thy old drunkenneſſe, and railing at good men,<note place="margin">1 John 3.20.</note> and good meanes? as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If our conſcience condemne us; God is greater then our Conſciences, and knoweth all things:</hi> ſo the Soule ſaith, I know thus much by my ſelfe, but God knowes more.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, as the guilt of ſinne cannot be removed, nor Conſcience quieted, meerely in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties, if the Conſcience be truely inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened: ſo in the laſt place, the ſinne that hath taken poſſeſſion in the heart cannot bee ſubdued by the power of any performance that hee doth. I ſpeake ſtill of one that is not yet ingrafted into Chriſt: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt his ſinne he will; but kil it, and ſubdue it, that hee cannot: and hence it is, that the Lord lets
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18422:14"/>
in upon the Soule a great many infirmities, and a ſwarme of weakeneſſes that are preſent with the Soule: and ſo hee ſeeth an utter inabilitie in himſelfe to help himſelfe againſt them; the one of theſe two things befalls him. If hee be a man of meane parts, and ſmall gifts, hee ſeeth himſelfe ſo weake, and ſo unprofitable under all meanes, that his Soule almoſt ſinkes downe in deſperate diſcouragement; and when he gets nothing by all the duties that he doth, he falls out with himſelfe, and pineth almoſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation. And if hee be a man of great parts, and gifts, and learning, and hath wiſedome to conceive of things; the Lord ſuffers many corruptions to fall upon him: and when hee comes to humble himſelfe before God, he ſaith, I am able to diſcourſe of this, and that; and I can heare, and pray; but (oh) this heart of mine: a man had as good move a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as move my heart; this hard heart will not ſtirre, nor be broken under all, and helped againſt theſe as it ſhould bee. Now, the Soule upon theſe termes is even content to leave off all: and it befalls the heart in this caſe, as it did <hi>Hagar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 21.15, 16.</note> When her bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of water was ſpent, ſhe caſt the child under a tree, and ſate a farre off, becauſe ſhee would not ſee the child die; ſo it is with the Soule. When the bottles of theſe Saints, and ſcantie duties are done, the ſoule ſits down in diſcouragement, and ſaith, Good Lord, it will never bee, my Soule ſhall never bee accepted, and my ſinnes will never bee pardoned; and the heart begins to reaſon thus with himſelfe, and ſaith; I have had as good meanes as ever any poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had, and many gracious friends have counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18422:15"/>
mee, and yet the guilt of my ſinnes is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eies; and my Conſcience is not yet quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Nay, theſe ſinnes, this blind mind, and this hard heart will not bee ſubdued; but the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt can doe more then thou, and the world too. The Lord will make thee ſee that thou and the world can doe nothing, that Chriſt may take away the guilt of ſinne, and quiet thy Conſcience, and ſubdue thy corruptions for thee: thus much hee ſeeth from his owne experience.</p>
               <p>The ſecond paſſage is this; as his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes the Soule confeſſe that there is no hope of good in himſelfe; ſo the example of others doth confirme a broken hearted ſinner in this; that all the creatures in the world, and all the duties under Heaven without Chriſt, cannot purchaſe ſalvation to the Soule; becauſe the Soule now ſeeth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders in the Scriptures, that many thouſands have had all theſe priviledges, and done many duties, and yet come ſhort of perfection. Many reprobates have had theſe priviledges as well as Gods people; and the Soule thinkes thus with it ſelfe: If beautie, or honours, or riches, might have purchaſed eternall life; then <hi>Pharaoh, Abſolon,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> ſhould have beene accepted of God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, What have I that many thouſands have not had? and, What doe I that reprobates have not done, and yet for ought I know, it never did them good? <hi>Iſaac</hi> was circumciſed, and ſo was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> too; <hi>Abell</hi> offered Sacrifice, ſo did <hi>Cain</hi> too; and the ſtony ground received the Word with joy, and many there were that waited upon God in the uſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18422:15"/>
of his Ordinances, as you may ſee in the Prophet <hi>Eſay. Ahab</hi> faſted, and <hi>Iudas</hi> repented,<note place="margin">Eſay, 58.2, 3.</note> and yet he is a divell now in hell this day:<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.3.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, If the Lord ſhould marke what is done amiſſe, who could abide it? there was enough in <hi>Davids</hi> praiers to condemne him; and if all theſe did thus, and much more then I can doe; Then why ſhould I thinke to find more helpe in my praiers then they did: thus the Soule ſeeth that Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never had Iuſtification from any priviledges that they enjoyed, nor from any duties that they did, without relying on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the greatneſſe of the evill which now the Soule ſeeth, and the deſperate miſery wherein it is, is ſo great, that now it finds an utter in-abilitie, that all the creatures under heaven ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove the evill of it. For the ſoare that is made, and the wound that is given by ſinne, is broader then all the ſalve (that the creatures can apply) is able to cover. The Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and duties cannot reach the evill that lyes upon the heart in this particular; and this is conſiderable; the meanes that muſt comfort and quiet the heart in diſtreſſe, muſt be able to beare the wrath of God, and to take away the venome and poyſon of the wrath of the Almightie. Now, the Soule ſeeth that no creature can doe this; no creature can beate backe Gods wrath but it will fall; and hence it is that the Lord ſaith, hee hath laid ſalvation upon one that is mightie; there are mightie corruptions, and mightie indignation, and mightie guilt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord hath laid ſalvation upon the mightie.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18422:16"/>
It muſt be more then a creature, that muſt beare or remoove the wrath of the Creator; As the text ſaith, <hi>There is no other name under heaven, whereby you can bee ſaved but only by Chriſt.</hi> Prayer ſaith, there is no ſalvation in mee; and the Sacraments and Faſting ſay, there is no ſalvation in us; there is ſalvation in no other but in Chriſt. The other are ſubſervient helps, not abſolute cauſes of ſalvation; As the holy Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 3.23.</note> ſhewing the peoples deſperate condition and there miſery therein, ſaith, <hi>In vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the mountaines;</hi> hee had ſaid before in the 22. verſe, <hi>Returne againe, oh, diſobedient children and I will heale your rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and they anſwered, <hi>behold wee come Lord for thou art the Lord our God, and in vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the mountaines:</hi> By ſalvation in the mountaines is meant the Idols ſet up in the hilles, which the poore people worſhipped, and thought they were able to ſuccour them, but in the day of trouble, they ſaid, wee come Lord, for in vaine is ſalvation hoped for from the mountaines. So, if thou truſt in thy praying, and hearing, and good works, though thou hadſt a mountaine of them, they can doe thee no good, unleſſe with the eye of faith, thou lookeſt upon Chriſt for acceptance: but in the Lord our God is ſalvation for evermore. Then gather up all: if the Soule ſeeth by experience, that no good will come by theſe, and if examples ſhew ſo much, and if the greatneſſe of the evill, ſhew that it is impoſſible for any comfort or pardon to be brought home to the Soule; barely by theſe meanes, then the heart concludes thus, and ſaith; theſe will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18422:16"/>
not doe the deed, I may have all theſe priviledges, and performe all theſe duties, and yet ſalvation is not in theſe; if I truſt in them, there is no pardon in them, and no hope of redemption from them ſaith the Soule. The Soule doth not deſpaire of all good in Chriſt, but the Lord is compeld (as I may ſay with reverence) to weary us from this confidence in our ſelves, and from ſeeking any ſuccour from our ſelves, that he may make us goe to Chriſt.</p>

Let us have our hearts raiſed up from our owne bottomes, and let us plucke downe the foundations that we have had in priviledges, or any ſervice done by us at any time. This is that which above all things we muſt doe; all the Saints of God have found this, from day to day, after ſearch made, then why ſhould we ſeeke for ſuccour from theſe; I ſay, we muſt not neglect theſe duties, but we muſt not reſt upon them.

What is that? a man is wholly poſſeſſed with a body of corruption, and the Spawne of all abhomination hath overſpread the whole man, and it leavens all the whol lump of body and mind. You often read this phraſe in Scripture, but you perceive it not; as it is with a dead body being deprived of the Soule (which did quicken it, and enable it to doe the workes of a reaſonable man) there comes a kind of ſenceleſneſſe, and after that, all noyſome humours breed in the body; and all filthy vermin come from the body, and therefore a man may bury it, but hee cannot quicken it any more. Iuſt ſo it is with the Soule that is deprived of the glorious preſence of Gods Spirit, and grace which <hi>Adam</hi> had in his innocency: For, looke what the Soule is to the body, the ſame is the grace of Gods Spirit to the Soule.

You ſee the ſinner in the pit; But will you ſee him ſinking into the bottome? I am loath to ſpeake the worſt: Nay, I durſt not have thought it, had not the Lord Chriſt ſpoken it in his Word. Therefore ſee what hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.70.</note> 
                  <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one of you is a Divell?</hi> Who was that? It was <hi>Iudas.</hi> Why, what did he? What, a dead man, and a damned man, and a divell too: What will become of ſuch a poore forlorne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It is ſaid of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that the Divell put it into his heart to betray Chriſt, out of a covetous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to get money, and the <hi>Divell entred into Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> Thus the divell puts it into his mind,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.27.</note> and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted it into his heart, to deviſe a way how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe his end: nay, the Divell entred into <hi>Iudas,</hi> not by a corporall poſſeſſion; but by a ſpirituall kind of rule, which the divell did exerciſe over <hi>Iudas,</hi> that is, when the divels counſell, and adviſe tooke place with <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Maſter: this is not <hi>Iudas</hi> his condition alone, but it is the condition of all men by nature. That, looke as it ſaid of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>They were inſpired with the Spirit of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.4.</note> and as it is ſaid of all ſound Chriſtians. <hi>They are led
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18422:20"/>
by the Spirit of God:</hi> So, on the contrary, the wicked are led by,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.</note> and with the ſpirit of the divell, <hi>He rules in the hearts of the children of diſobedience:</hi> The divell caſts wicked thoughts into their hearts, and carries them into the commiſſion of thoſe evils, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had ſuggeſted: The divell rules in them; he ſpeakes by their tongues, and workes by their hands, and thinks, and deſires by their minds, and walkes by their feet;<note place="margin">Revel. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>The divell ſhall caſt ſome of you in priſon,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> All men are naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Sathan, and therefore Saint <hi>Paul was ſent to preach the Goſpel that he might deliver them from the power of Sathan to God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> You thinke your ſelves brave men, and you can deſpiſe the word, and the grace of God and abuſe his Miniſters: Alas, the divell hath power over you; as it is with a dead ſheepe, all the carrion Crowes in the Countrey come to prey upon it, and all baſe vermin breede and creepe there: So, it is with every poore naturall ſinfull carnall creature under heaven; a company of divels, like ſo many carrion crowes prey upon the heart of a poore creature, and all baſe luſts crall, and feed, and are maintained in ſuch a wretched heart. Now (brethren) thinke of all theſe, and ſearch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. It is better to know this now, then to know it when there is no remedy: I ſay no more for pitie; is it ſo with thee, and mee, and all of us by nature? Then judge the caſe clearely, and paſſe the verdict. Doeſt thou thinke that a few faint cold prayers, and lazy wiſhes, and a little horror of heart can plucke a dead man from the grave of his ſinnes, and a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoule from the pit of hell, and change the nature
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18422:20"/>
of a divell to be a Saint? No, it is not poſſible; and know that the worke of renovation, is greater then the worke of thy creation; and there is no helpe in earth, either goe to Chriſt, or there is no ſuccour for thee. We can pitty poore drunkards, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them; but we are as able to make worlds, and to pull hell in pieces; as to pull a poore Soule from the paw of the divell. Nay, he is a divell, and a damned divell, as you have heard: if this were well conſidered; it would daſh in pieces, all thoſe carnall conceits of a great many, which make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of turning a divell to be a Saint.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider ſeriouſly the infirmitie,<note place="margin">The ſecond meanes.</note> and feebleneſſe, and the emptineſſe of all meanes that we enjoy, and all duties that we doe: it were argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough, to perſwade a poore broken-hearted ſinner, not to relye upon a poore broken reede that will deceive him when he hath moſt need: therefore ſince they cannot ſuccour us, let us draw our hearts from reſting on them. This is a matter of great weight alſo; for the Soule being thus broken for ſinne, ſets a great matter of excellency, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in holy duties. Nay, people hang all their hope of eternall life, upon what they have, and what they can doe. Come to a poore broken hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and tell him of his ſinne, that he ſtands guiltie of. Marke what his reply is. I confeſſe (ſaith he) it is true; I have beene ſo, and ſo, but the world is well amended, I meddle not with my ſinnes, and I have reformed all thoſe baſe courſes. Nay, the Lord knowes that my corruptions have coſt mee hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my heart hath beene exceedingly vexed with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18422:21"/>
them, I hope, I have had my hell here, and I ſhall no hell hereafter. Alas, poore wretch, is this the hooke that upholds thy heart, and is this all the ground that thou goeſt upon? it is good that thou doeſt repent and amend, and reforme thy wayes, and bleſſed be God, for what hee hath made thee able to doe; but, this I muſt tell thee; If thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and reformation be all thy hope, and thou relyeſt upon them, as the Iewes did upon their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall righteouſneſſe: thy Soule and all will ſinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly; if thou looke no further for helpe, for all theſe cannot procure thy acceptance before God in that great Day of accounts; nor give any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods Iuſtice. Now the weakeneſſe of all theſe priviledges, and duties, may appeare in five particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thou canſt not do that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God requires of thee,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.14.</note> in all this that thou ſo much braggeſt of. <hi>Thou haſt a hard heart, and canſt not repent:</hi> If thou canſt doe what God requires of thee; then why doeſt thou not breake that hard heart of thine. It is a heart that cannot repent. The Saints of God finde this; though they ſee their ſinnes, yet their hearts will not breake. Thou art as able to rend the rocks in pieces, as to breake thy hard heart. <hi>The good that I would doe</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul),</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I cannot doe, and the evill that I would not doe, that I doe.</hi> The Church complaines of it, and ſaith? Why are our hearts hardened from thy feare. Therefore God may juſtly take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou art not many times carefull to doe what thou canſt; ſometimes thou letteſt paſſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18422:21"/>
opportunities; and if thou takeſt the occaſions, it is marvellous ſlightly, and hoverly; though God have put power, and abilitie into thy heart, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme holy duties; ſo, that thou ſeeſt the occaſions, yet thou ſlighteſt them over moſt ſhamefully.<note place="margin">Iam. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we ſinne all,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) and the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſa. 64.7.</note> 
                  <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, neither ſtirreth he up himſelf to take hold of thee.</hi> It was the common fault of the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, <hi>they all ſlumbred:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.5.</note> this befals even thoſe that are the moſt beloved of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Doe what thou canſt in the beſt of all thy ſervices; when thou commeſt to the higheſt pitch of the holineſſe of thy heart, and to the moſt ferventeſt prayers that ever thou didſt make, and the moſt broken heart that ever thou haddeſt, and the moſt exacteſt way of godlineſſe; I ſay in the very beſt of all thy duties; there is ſtill ſome imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for which God may in exact rigour frown upon thee: now Iudge this; can that ſervice ſave thee in which there is enough to condemne thee? thats impoſſible; in the beſt of thy duties there is enough to make God frowne upon thee. And therefore the Prieſt that was to offer Sacrifice;<note place="margin">Heb. 7, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Was to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſinne of his offering.</hi> Where we ſee that even the holieſt ſervice that ever the Miniſter puts up to God, and in the beſt care that ever he expreſt, he hath need to offer Sacrifice for his offering: and ſo it is in all your ſervices. You little thinke that God may condemne you, for your Prayers, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and Faſtings. But I will make it cleare to you: for, this is a common rule, we all beleeve in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18422:22"/>
part, we know in part, and we love in part, ſo that, though our hearts are renewed, yet they are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in part, there is ſome hatred mixed with our love, ſome unbeliefe with our faith, and ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with our knowledge: And as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, ſo that theſe two are contrary the one to the other.</hi> There is ſo much corruption in thee, ſo that when thou wouldeſt doe good, thou canſt not doe it with that readineſſe that thou oughteſt; thou canſt not doe it with all the whole ſtreame of thy heart. The Law requires, that wee ſhould love the Lord with all our hearts, and with all our ſtrength; So that we have no hangings backe in our duties; but in all our prayers, and hearings, and readings, there is fleſh that oppoſeth the ſpirit, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that croſſeth the worke of grace. So that we are not able to performe any ſervice, as God doth require of us: how backward are we to duties, and how weary in duties? what wandring thoughts? what privy pride? and what ſeeking of our ſelves have we in them? You know nothing, if you know not this; but whether you know it or no, it is ſo. There is much corruption, oppoſing and thwarting the worke of the Spirit; and therefore you had need pray for the repentance of your repentance; and to begge the pardon of all your prayers: and whereas you thinke, that you will repent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and heare, and pray, and the like; I tell you; that though it be commendable to pray, and heare; yet there is ſo much ſinne in your amendment, and repentance, and duties; that in exact juſtice God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18422:22"/>
may curſe all that you doe, and execute his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon you for the ſame, therefore theſe cannot ſave you. He that heretofore hath prophaned the will now Sanctifies it, and ſoe he thinks all is quit; but I tell thee that in all thy ſanctification of the ſame, thou haſt neede of a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Were it graunted, and let it be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (which I confeſſe will not, nay can never bee) but Imagine it were ſo; that after God hath opened a mans eyes and broken his heart, he ſhould never commit the leaſt ſinne in all the world, and never have any failing in holy duties, nor any diſtemper in his Soule, though this cannot bee; but Imagine it were ſo: that he did never ſinne after his repentance, yet even the ſinne of his nature which he brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world with him were enough to make the Lord take the advantage of him for ever, and to caſt away all that ever he doth as abhominable from his preſence. Our repentance, and our exacteſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties, though we could doe them even to the uttermoſt: it is a duty that we are bound to doe, and the doing of that which we owe; can never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for that which hath beene done amiſſe by us: but our repentance of ſinne and our reformation is a duty which the goſpell requires, and therefore will not ſatiſfie for that which is done amiſſe before our converſion. As a Tennant that is run behind hand with his Land-Lord ſoe many hundreths, and at laſt he begins to conſider with himſelfe what hee hath done, and he bringes the rent of the laſt halfe yeare when his leaſe is out, will this man thinke that hee hath now ſatiſfied his Land-Lord? if he ſhould ſay,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18422:23"/>
now Land-Lord, I hope you are contented, and all is anſwered and have fully paid all that is betweene you and mee, you Land-Lords would be ready to reply thus, and ſay, this ſatisfies mee for the laſt halfe yeare paſt, but who payes for the odde hundreths: ſo it is with a poore ſoule, be it ſo that after thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages that thou haſt run upon the ſcore with God, after all thy contempt, and pride and all thy Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bournes of Spirit, at laſt God opens thine eyes, and breakes thy heart, and gives thee a fight of, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for theſe ſinnes; wilt thou come before the Lord, and ſay, Lord, I haue repented of my ſinnes paſt, and ſoe I hope thy Iuſtice is ſatisfied, and all accounts made euen betweene thee and mee, the Lord would anſwere, it is true thou doſt repent and reforme thy ſelfe, the goſpell requires it, but who payes the od thouſands and who ſatisfies for thy old drunkennes, and for thy thouſands of pride and Stubborneſſe, and all thy careleſnes, and all thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and his grace, and who ſatisfies for all thy blaſphemies, and omiſſions of holy duties, and the like, the Lord may juſtly take the forfeit of thy Soule and proceede in Iudgement againſt thee to thy deſtruction for ever. our repentance and amendment is a new dutie which the Lord requires of us from the goſpell, but it is not the paying of the old debt; for if we do not repent, we ſtand guiltie of the breach of the goſpell, and ſoe muſt ſatisfie for that ſinne. The breach of the Law is ſinne, and the wages of ſin is death, the wages of ſinne is not repentance nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, but it is death; then repentance will not ſatisfie for ſinne: noe, noe, the wages that muſt bee laid downe for a mans ſinne, is death. As the Lord
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18422:23"/>
ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt of the forbidden fruite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt dye the death. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>curſed is every one that continues not in all things written in the Law to doe them.</hi> Repentance is onely a worke of the goſpell to bring our hearts in frame againe, but the breach of the Law muſt be ſatisfied for; ſoe that, having ſinned againſt the Lord and wronged his Iuſtice we muſt either dye our ſelves or have one to dye for us; then, there is noe laying downe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſatisfaction to God by any thing that we can doe in this caſe but we muſt have recourſe to our Saviour who onely can ſatisfie gods wrath for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As a ſinner is utterly unable to bring himſelfe into a good eſtate, by all the meanes that he can uſe; ſo he is unable to maintaine his lot: and to keepe himſelfe aforehand in a Chriſtian courſe, when he is brought unto it. Therefore as it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have a Saviour to pardon us: So, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have a Saviour, to continue that eſtate of grace to us for our good. When the Lord in mercy had given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, perfect holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe; inſomuch that hee was able to keepe the Law, and to purchaſe favour for himſelfe, <hi>Adam</hi> then fell, and ſpent all that ſtock of grace; and if we had our ſtocke in our owne hands, we ſhould ſpend all and be ruinated for ever, if God did leave us to our ſelves. If <hi>Adam</hi> having no ſinne, could not keepe himſelfe in that happy eſtate; much leſſe are we able that have much corruption in us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not onely required to goe to Chriſt for grace to pardon us; but we muſt goe to Chriſt to maintaine our grace, and to keepe our hearts in frame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18422:24"/>
here, and to bring us to a Kingdome for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſpent all the ſtocke of grace; and proved a bankrupt, the Lord would raiſe him up againe; but he would not put the ſtocke into his owne hands againe; but he puts it into the hands of Chriſt. As, a man that gives his childe a portion, and he ſpends it all; now his father will raiſe him againe, but will not put it into his owne hands, but into the hands of ſome friend, and will have his Sonne goe to that man for his allowance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and for every meale: So, it is with the Lord our heavenly Father, becauſe we have miſpent all that wiſedome, and holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, which God gave <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to all of us; therefore the Lord would not put the ſtock of grace into our owne hands againe, but he hath put it into the hands of Chriſt, and will have us depend upon Chriſt for every crum of grace; yea, even for the will to doe any good; and we muſt goe to him, that he may preſerve and maintaine the worke of grace in us; and wonderfull happy are we that it is ſo. For, ſhould the Lord ſet the divell, and us together, all were gone. The Lord Ieſus gives grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it, and helps us to perſevere in grace; and ſo makes us come to the end of our hopes, even the ſalvation of our Soules. Oh therefore, looke up to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt; and ſay, Oh, it is a bleſſed mercy; that when my heart is proud, vaine, looſe, and fooliſh; that then I may goe to the Fountaine of grace,<note place="margin">1 Peter. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5.</note> for humilitie, and for grace. We are kept (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter) By the power of God through faith unto ſalvation:</hi> As if he had ſaid, all the powers of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18422:24"/>
hell and darkneſſe are come about us, and a world of wickedneſſe beſets us, and all the powers of the world, and the corruptions of our owne hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure us. Now, we cannot ſtand by our own ſtrength, therefore we have need of a Chriſt, that we may be kept by his power, and be able to ſuffer, and to doe any thing for his names ſake, and that hee may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us in that great day of accounts.<note place="margin">1 John 4.4.</note> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Little children you are of God and have overcome the world, for greater is hee that is in you, then hee that is in the world.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, greater are you, then he that is in the world, but greater is he that is in you, &amp;c. Hee doth not ſay, greater is your humilitie then your pride; greater is your patience, then your impatience; and greater is your love, then your hatred; but he ſaith, The Lord Ieſus is greater in us, to ſuccour and to helpe us; then all the temptations of the divell, and the corruptions of our hearts that can preſſe in upon us, to doe us any hurt, or to hinder us in a Chriſtian courſe. Doeſt thou thinke thy owne hearing, and praying, and duties will ſerve the turne and ſave thy Soule? No, no, thou art an undone man, if thou reſt upon thy owne crazie bottomes? Amend thou mayeſt, and pray thou oughteſt; but theſe will not ſave thee; theſe will not cauſe the acceptation of thy perſon with God; nor juſtifie thy Soule before his Tribunall. All theſe are poore, weake, and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie meanes? For, if thou canſt not doe what God requires; and if thou doeſt not what thou art able, and if in the beſt of thy ſervices, there is pride, and ſtubbornneſſe enough to condemne thee, and when
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18422:25"/>
thou riſeſt up from prayer, thou hadſt need pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for pardon of thy prayer: Nay, couldſt thou doe all that thou ſhouldeſt after converſion; in the moſt ſtricteſt and exacteſt manner; yet that doth not ſatisfie for the ſinne, that thou hadſt committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion; and if thou canſt not maintaine thy owne grace, then there is an abſolute neceſſitie of going to Chriſt for all. Nay, aske your owne hearts, and ſervices; and ſay thus? prayer, wilt not thou ſave mee, and hearing? wilt not thou ſave me; they will all profeſſe plainly, and ſay; ſalvation is not in mee (ſaith prayer), and ſalvation is not in me (ſaith hearing), and ſalvation is not in me (ſaith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and amendment; Indeed, wee have heard of a Chriſt; that hee hath dyed, and ſatisfied, and ſuffered, and riſen, and delivered his poore ſervants; and pluckt poore Soules from hell; and we need a Saviour to pardon us, alas, we cannot ſave our ſelves. All thy duties will ſay to thee, as the King ſaid to the woman; when the famine was great in Samaria: <hi>And the King was going upon the wall, there cryed a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 6.26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaying, Helpe, oh King. And the King made this anſwer, If the Lord God ſuccour not, how can I helpe?</hi> So, mee thinkes the Soule ſaith; When it is beſieged with the wrath of God? Oh helpe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hearing, and Sacrament, and the like? Mee thinks, I heare them reply in this manner; Alas, how can we helpe, you have prayed ſinfully; and heard the Word untowardly; and received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments unworthily? Oh, let us all goe to heaven for a Mediator; good Lord, pardon the ſinne of theſe prayers, and theſe hearings, and the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18422:25"/>
of theſe Sacraments; and all this frothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and deadneſſe in hearing: Thus they will all ſend you to heaven for a Chriſt; and ſay, alas, I cannot ſave you; how many commands have I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed? how many duties have I ſlighted, and therefore ſend to Chriſt for pardon; we are weake, and feeble, and onely come to the eare, and to the eye; but the Lord Ieſus muſt come downe from heaven, and be powerfull, every way to doe good to your Soules. You muſt goe to a Chriſt, to batter the proud fleſh; and to pardon all that is amiſſe, and to performe all duties that you would have done. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> tooke up the cloake of <hi>Eliah,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>where is the God of Eliah;</hi> he did not ſay?<note place="margin">2 King. 2.14.</note> Where is the the cloake, but where is the God of <hi>Eliah.</hi> All the ordinances of God, are but as the barke of the tree; but Chriſt and the Promiſe are the pith. The heart, and life, and power of all is in Chriſt onely: therefore looke higher then theſe, for they doe all proclaime; that there is no ſuccour but in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third meanes to drive our hearts from reſting upon our duties is this.<note place="margin">The third meanes.</note> We muſt conſider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable hazzard, and danger, and the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that will come if we put any affiance in any of thoſe priviledges that we have, or any duties that we performe. The very conſideration hereof is able to withdraw our hearts from reſting upon them. The danger appeares in two particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This carnall confidence in what we have, and doe ſhut a man out from having any part in Chriſt. He that is guiltie of this ſinne, withdrawes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18422:26"/>
himſelfe from the favour of the Lord, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uncapable of that mercy and good which God hath revealed; and Chriſt hath purchaſed for poore diſtreſſed ſinners. For this is all that the Lord lookes for at our hands, that we ſhould deny our ſelves, and wholy caſt our ſelves upon his goodnes and mercy. nay, that man which relyes upon what he doth, puts himſelfe without the reach of all that mercy and great ſalvation that is in Ieſus Chriſt. Chriſt came not to call the righteous to repentance, nor them that truſt in themſelves; nor them that thinke they can ſave themſelves, but he came to call ſinners to repentance, and thoſe that ſee an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency in themſelves to ſave or ſuccour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the day of trouble, there is great ſalvation in Chriſt, and plenteous redemption purchaſsed by Chriſt, and you heare of all this, and it is all true, but this I muſt tell you, all that Chriſt hath done and deſerved ſhall never doe you good, if you reſt upon your ſelves. You doe thinke that it is ſuch a great ſin, as indeed it is, ſometimes you make conſcience of drunkennes and other ſinnes, if you make conſcience of any thing, then know that this is the greateſt ſinne in the world.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> See how the Apoſtle ſets himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this carnall confidence, where ſpeaking to the Galathians that truſted in their owne circumciſion, that anſwers to our Baptiſme: Behold (ſaith he) I Paul, ſay, I, not a bare man, but I, Paul enſpired with the Spirit in an extraordinary manner, and I, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle that doe not, nay that cannot erre, I that have received a commiſſion from the Lord, I ſay, that if you be Circumciſed, that is, if you truſt in your

Circumciſion, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. nay, (ſaith he) <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is made of none effect to you if you ſeeke to bee juſtified by the workes of the Law.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> If you reſt in the merit of your prayer, Chriſt is made of none effect to you, and you ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any power from the death of Chriſt: the bloud of Chriſt will never purge thoſe filthy hearts of yours, and his reſurrection ſhall never quicken you. Whatſoever your caſe and condition is, or can be, if your ſinnes were never ſo haynous for greatnes, continuance and for number, if you wil but renounce your ſelves and goe to Chriſt nothing ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you, but if your ſinnes were never ſoe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and amended: and reformation, nay, Chriſt himſelfe ſhall never doe you any good. It is with the Soule of a poore ſinner, as it is with the body of a man. If it had ſome ſlightie diſeaſe or ſicknes, and that may (haply) be cured, but if his throate begin to ſwell, and the vitall paſſages be ſtopped up that he can receive no meat nor phiſicke, every neighbour will ſay, he is but a dead man, all the meanes and men in the world can doe him no good, he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing downe: So it is with the Soule; it is annoyed with many baſe corruptions, and ſinfull diſtempers; and if it be wounded with many rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; there is meanes enough in Chriſt to cure all? If thou were a filthy beſotted drunkard, or an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, the blood of Chriſt can purge thy drunken adulterous heart, one touch of Chriſt, can cure all: thy bloody iſſue. If thou wert dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, the Lord Ieſus could quicken thee, and raiſe thee from death to life; but if thy proud heart
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18422:27"/>
ſwell with thy owne ſufficiency, and thou wilt reſt upon thy ſelfe, all the merits and grace in Chriſt can doe thee no good. This is the maine conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.40.</note> into which all the reſt is reſolved. <hi>You will not come to mee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that you might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> He doth not ſay; you have many ſinnes and ſhall not be ſaved; but, you will not come to me, &amp;c. that is, you will not goe out from your ſelves to the Lord Chriſt; and therefore cannot receive mercy and grace from his Majeſties hands: though thou art never ſo baſe and vile, if thou couldſt goe to the Lord Ieſus, and reſt upon him for mercy, nothing ſhould ſtand betweene thee and heaven, but if thou ſtickeſt in thy ſelfe, all the grace in Chriſt can doe thee no good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This carnall confidence, makes a man unprofitable, under all the meanes that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes;<note place="margin">Ier. 17.5, 6.</note> As the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that trusts in the arme of fleſh, and departs from the Lord;</hi> Why? What ſhall become of him? the text ſaith, <hi>he ſhall be like an heath in the wilderneſſe, and ſhall never ſee good.</hi> The nature of the heath is this; though all the dew of heaven, and all the ſhowers in the world fall upon it; and though the Sunne ſhine never ſo hotly, it will never grow fruitfull, it will never yield any fruit of increaſe, but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull ſtill. Such a Soule thou wilt be; thou that reſteſt upon thy own ſervices &amp;, ſayeſt; becauſe thou heareſt, and prayeſt, and doeſt ſanctifie the Lords Day; therefore thou muſt needs goe to heaven; I ſay, thou ſhalt never ſee good by all the meanes of grace; if thou makeſt them independent cauſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18422:27"/>
all the promiſes in the Goſpel ſhall never eſtabliſh thee, and all the judgements in the world will never terrifie thee; thou ſhalt never have any ſaving grace wrought in thee by them: The truth is, hee that hath all meanes, and hath not a Chriſt in all; hee ſhall never ſee good by all. Therefore thou that reſteſt upon thy parts, and gifts, and upon thy duties; thou wilt have a heart ſo beſotted, that grace will never come into thy heart, and God will never quiet thy conſcience. It may be a poore drunkard is converted and humbled; but thou ſtandeſt ſtill, and canſt get no good by all the means in the world. Therefore ſay thus to thy ſelfe? doth this carnall confidence cut mee off from all the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that is in Chriſt; and without mercy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from Chriſt I am undone for ever; and without grace I am a poore defiled wretch here, and ſhall be damned for ever after; if I reſt here, I may bid adue to all mercy: Nay, all the meanes that I have, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe mee good. Is this the fruit of my carnall confidence? Oh Lord withdraw my heart from it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, When all the meanes of grace, will not plucke away the Soule from reſting upon it ſelfe,<note place="margin">The fourth meanes.</note> when reaſon will not rule him, nor meanes will not prevaile with a poore ſinner, as commonly a great while they will not; then the Lord tires a poore Soule with his owne diſtempers. And the Lord deales with the Soule, as an enemy deales with a Caſtle that he hath beſieged; When the Citizens will not yield up the Caſtle, he famiſheth them, and cuts off all proviſion, and makes them conſume within, and ſo at laſt they are forced to reſigne it up
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18422:28"/>
upon any termes. So, When the Lord hath laid ſiege to a carnall heart, and hath ſhewed him his woefull condition, and yet the heart will not of, nor will not take up any termes of peace, but ſtill hee will ſhift for himſelfe. Now, what doth the Lord doe? hee takes away the comfort of all the meanes that he hath, till hee is famiſhed with the want of Gods favour; and then hee is content to yield up all to the God of heaven and earth. It was juſt ſo with this Prodigall; all the world could not perſwade him but he might live better of his porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo away hee goes; and when hee had tried the world, and could get no ſuccour, at laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, it was better to be at a fathers finding, and now he ſaw that a fathers houſe was admirably good, and that the ſervants and children in their fathers houſe are happy; for they have bread enough and enough againe, and to ſpare too: and ſo hee is forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. So, it is with many poore diſtreſſed ſoules: all the arguments under heaven cannot quiet them, and all the meanes in the world cannot plucke them from themſelves; and we tell them daily, that they muſt not expect grace, nor power, nor pardon from themſelves;<note place="margin">2 Ioh. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>It is mercy and peace</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle). You would have peace of conſcience, and pardon of ſinne, and aſſurance of Gods love; and whence would you have it, you would have it from your duties? it is not prayer, and peace, nor hearing, and peace; but it is mercy and peace; and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Lord Ieſus, that you may receive mercy from him: Yet we cannot get poore creatures from themſelves, but they would faine ſhuffle for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18422:28"/>
and have a little comfort of their owne, and they ſay, Lord, cannot my prayers, my care and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting merit ſalvation? Now, what doth God then? he ſaith, to ſuch a Soule, goe try then, put to the beſt of thy ſtrength, and uſe all the meanes that thou canſt, and ſee what thou canſt doe; See if thou canſt cure thy conſcience, and heale thoſe wounds of thine; and ſubdue the corruptions of thy heart, with thy prayers and abilities: but when the Soule hath made triall, and weltred, and wearied it ſelfe, at laſt, he finds that all the meanes he can uſe cannot quiet him, nor comfort his conſcience, and the poore ſinner is pinched and wearied, and the Lord will not anſwer his prayers, nor ſweeten the deſires of his Soule, and the Lord will not bleſſe the Word to him for his comfort, and at laſt, the Soule ſaith: Such a poore Chriſtian (even a man of meane parts, and weake gifts) how is he comforted, and ſuch a profane drunkard is puld home, and hath gotten the aſſurance of Gods love; The Lord hath puld downe the proud hearts of ſuch and ſuch; and they live comfortably, and ſweetly; and I have no peace nor aſſurance of Gods love. You may thanke your ſelves for it; they ſaw nothing, and they looked for nothing from themſelves; and therefore they went home to the gate of mercy to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and they have bread enough, if you would come home to Chriſt, you might have beene comforted alſo. Now therefore, goe to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and as certainly, as God is in heaven; refreſhing and comfort will come into your hearts, and mercy (which is better then marrow) ſhall ſatisfie thoſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18422:29"/>
feeble fainting ſpirits of yours. You ſee what the way is, and what the helps be to pluck off our hearts from reſting upon theſe duties, and therefore thinke thus with thy ſelfe, and ſay, is my miſery ſo great? and are my duties ſo weake? and is my carnall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo dangerous; that I may be troubled for ever? for any thing that I can doe of my ſelfe; and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort no where elſe to be had, but in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt? Oh then Lord, worke my heart to this duty. Sticke not in your ſelves, doe all this, but goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that you can doe, and labour ſo to approve your hearts to God, that you may ſee greater mercy in God, then in all that you can doe.</p>
               <p>Now there are two Cavils, which carnall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſlander this truth of God withall; and theſe muſt be anſwered before I can come to the trials.</p>

Firſt, howſoever thy good workes are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſave thee, yet thy evill workes are enough to damne thee. As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>that all they might bee damned which beleeved not the truth but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> You that take pleaſure in your drunkennes, and prophaneſſe, and in your ji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and jeſting at the meanes of grace, there is roome enough in hell for you all: that all you might be damned. Yea, thou that delighteſt in thy drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, thou maiſt drinke downe thy laſt, and thy damnation too, and thou that blaſphemeſt againſt the truth of Chriſt, take heed that God poure not downe his wrath upon thee. It is true, though thy good workes are not perfectly good and cannot ſave thee, yet thy bad workes are perfectly naught and and will condemne thee. nay, thy prayers are an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination to the Lord, and will the Lord ſave thee for that which is abhominable to him? thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hell is broke looſe becauſe mercy is come into the world, this thy wickednes will condemne thee for evermore. Secondly, they that thus ſtand it out againſt Gods free grace in Ieſus Chriſt (the Lord in mercy open their eyes, my ſoule mournes for them and for that ſtrange puniſhment that ſhall befall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18422:30"/>
them, except the Lord breake their hearts in time) as any ſinne is enough to condemne them, ſo their ſinne is of an unconceiveable hainouſneſſe, and their judgement will be anſwerable. Their ſinne is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come out of meaſure ſinfull, becauſe mercy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and they have made a mock of it. The very height of all, that wrath that is in God ſhall be their portion. Good Lord, is it poſſible that ever any man ſhould dare to deſpiſe the mercy of God, and to trample the blood of Chriſt under his feete, and not onely to commit wantonneſſe, but to turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and to make the Lord Chriſt the Patron of all their filthineſſe? How will the Lord Ieſus take it at at their hands: that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord Ieſus came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devill, they ſhould make Chriſt a meanes to uphold the works of the devill. Oh, that ever any man ſhould dare to ſinne, becauſe mercy abounds! and becauſe they heare that Chriſt will one day ſave them, therefore they in the meane time will do all they can againſt him that muſt ſave them. See what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith againſt ſuch, <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5.</note>

And thou ſayeſt, thou
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18422:30"/>
wilt be drunke, and prophane, becauſe thy ſobriety and thy good works cannot ſave thee. I tell thee, it is not bare ſcorning and bare prophanes, but there is a maſſe of vengeance in all theſe. And when thou ſhalt ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, and ſhall be indited for a drunkard, and a ſcorner, and a prophane perſon, and ſuch a one as haſt toſſed the people of God with ſcornes upon thy Ale-bench; when the Law hath thus proceeded againſt thee, then will mercy come in againſt thee, and ſay, Lord, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vengeance upon him for mee, and for me, ſaith another, for I have beene diſhonoured, and becauſe mercy did abound, he would have his ſinne abound alſo. And then comes in the blood of Chriſt, and cries aloud, ſaying, Vengeance againſt that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, indeed Lord, there's a poore wretch that knew no other, but vengeance (Lord) againſt that drunkard, and that ſcorner, becauſe my blood was ſhed, and mercy was offered, and hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed it. You that know your drunken neighbours and ſervants, and ſee their ryoting and ſcorning, tell them that there is a treaſure of vengeance in thoſe ſinnes; and you that are guilty of it, goe your wayes home and mourne, and the Lord give us hearts to mourne for you. You that know what this ſinne is, when you goe to the Lord in Prayer, put up one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for them, and ſay, Good Lord take away that treaſure of vengeance. Oh, pray that if it be poſſible this great ſinne may be pardoned. Thirdly, all ſuch perſons muſt know that it is carnall confidence, in the meanes that withdrawes a bleſſing from them in the uſe of the meanes. <hi>What things were gaine to mee</hi>

                  <hi>Let us alſo learne to maintaine good works</hi> for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſes.

When your hearts are troubled and diſquieted, all your duties knocke at your hearts, and ſay, would you not have mercy, and power againſt corruption, and ſome evidence of Gods favour? Oh (ſay you) it is that which we want, and it is all that we deſire in this world; Come then (ſaith Prayer and the Word) we will goe to Chriſt with you; there is all fulneſſe in him: this is the end of all the holy ordinances of God, not to make them Saviours: but to lead us to a Saviour.</p>

Though they are not meate yet they are as diſhes that bring the meate. They are the meanes whereby ſalvation hath

beene revealed, and is conveyed to you. There is a fountaine of grace in Chriſt, but the word, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Sacraments, and faſting, theſe are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duites to convey this water of life, and to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this grace to us. You doe not uſe to drinke the conduite, but the water that the conduite bringes. Aske, that your joy may be full, (ſaith our Saviour) and ſo the Lord ſpeakes by the Prophet Eſay,<note place="margin">Eſay. 55.3.</note> 
                  <hi>incline your eare, and come unto mee, heare and your ſoules ſhall live.</hi> As if he had ſaid waite upon God in his word and ordinances, and your ſoules ſhall live.

                  <note place="margin">Colloſſ. 2.3.</note> If you would have any grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, the treaſure of it is in Chriſt. The word is as the Indenture or great will of God whereby the treaſure of Gods favour is made knowne to your Soules. The bond or will is not the treaſure, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes the treaſure to us, and makes us have a right, and title to it: our Saviour ſaith, my peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, and, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Chriſt are, yea, and Amen. yea, that is truth it ſelfe, and, Amen, that is confimed now, you muſt receive the tenure of all theſe in Chriſt. And the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments, are as the broad ſeales whereby the Covenant of grace is confirmed, made authenticall and ratified to your Soules. When a man hath much goods and lands and would make an other his heire, he paſſeth his lands or goods over to him by will, and if the will is not onely drawne but alſo ſealed, then, though this will is not the treaſure it ſelfe, yet it is a ſpeciall meanes to convey this treaſure to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18422:32"/>
heire that muſt have it. So, the Word is the will of God, and the Sacraments are the Seales of it, and all that mercy and goodneſſe in Chriſt is made knowne to you by the Word, and made ſure to you by the Sacrament; the Word and Sacraments are not this treaſure, but they are bleſſed meanes to convey this treaſure to your Soules. Therefore, when your hearts, are dead, weake and heavy, and you begin to breath for ſome conſolation, ſaying, who will tell mee how I may have my dead heart quickned, and my heavy heart refreſhed, as <hi>David once breathed for the water of Bethlem;</hi> then mee thinkes the word and prayer, and Sacraments doe all ſay, we will goe to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt for all theſe for you, and then Chriſt will ſanctifie you in his word, and if you have ſtrong devils hanging upon you, faſting, and prayer will fetch power and grace from Chriſt; and caſt all theſe devils out: So then you ſee their good uſe of all theſe. Thirdly, the laſt uſe of the meanes is this,<label type="milestone">

                  </label> For the anſwer to this queſtion, you muſt know that there are three particular trialls of our owne hearts, whereby wee ſhall know when the Lord is pleaſed to deale ſo kindly and ſweetly with us, as to drive us from our ſelves to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt triall.</note>Firſt, the Soule of a poore ſinner that ſeeth all meanes helpleſſe and hopeleſſe in themſelves, will freely confeſſe and acknowledge (and that openly) that the worke of ſalvation is of an unconceiveable difficulty, and he ſeeth an utter inſufficiencie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in himſelfe, and in any meanes in the world to be ſaved of himſelfe: He ſeeth that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his power, and the ſtaffe is out of his owne hand, and the Soule almoſt ſinks under it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it almoſt impoſſible to come out of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that which it apprehends. Hee ſeeth now that all thoſe broken reedes and rotten props, and all that boldneſſe whereby the heart did beare up it ſelfe, they are all broken in peeces, and all thoſe Caſtles which he hath built in the ayre, wherein hee
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18422:33"/>
comforted himſelfe with dreames of conſolation, they are all throwne downe to the ground, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about his eares, and now the Soule wonders how he was ſo deluded, to truſt to ſuch lying vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to ſuch deceitfull ſhadowes. This is the difference that the Soule will finde in it ſelfe before this worke of converſion, and after it is wrought. Before, a man thinks it an eaſie matter to come to heaven, and judgeth it a fooliſhneſſe in people to be caſt downe and diſcouraged in the hardneſſe and difficultie of the worke of ſalvation; and hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it to be a fooliſh conceit in the frantick braine of ſome preciſe Miniſters? Oh (ſaith he) God bleſſe us if none be ſaved, but ſuch as theſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſaith, a man may goe to heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and get the pardon of his ſinnes, it is nothing but confeſſing his ſinnes before God, and craving mercy in the pardon of them, and is this ſuch a hard matter; this man in the dayes of his vanitie, thinks he hath heaven in a ſtring, and mercy at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and he can come to heaven, and breake his heart at halfe an houres warning: but take this man when the Lord hath awakened his conſcience, and put him to the triall; when he ſeeth that after all his prayers and teares, yet his conſcience is not quieted, and his ſinnes are not pardoned, and the guilt ſtill remaines, now he is of another minde, now he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at himſelfe that he was ſo deluded, and now he ſaith? where is the deluded heart, that did thinke it, and the mouth that did ſpeake it: Nay, he thinks it a great mercy of God, that he is not in hell long agoe; and he ſtands and wonders that ever any man
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18422:34"/>
comes to heaven, and he ſaith, certainly their hearts are not like mine; and their ſinnes are not ſo great as mine, good Lord, who can ever be ſaved, ſuch a divell to tempt, and ſuch a world to allure, and ſuch corruptions boyling within. He wonders how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> got to heaven beyond the Starres, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> but above all <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> yet he ſaith, bleſſed be God that ever he did this for them, but for my ſelfe (all things conſidered) I thinke it a matter impoſſible, how I, nay, how can I ever be wrought upon? ſhall ever any mercy comfort mee? and ſhall ever any meanes doe mee good? Why have not all thoſe meanes that I have had done mee good, I ſhall never have power to pray better then I have done, and I ſhall never be able to wreſtle with God, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly then I have done, and yet I ſee all meanes profit not, therefore I am but a gone man. I am but loſt, and I know not which way my ſoule ſhould be ſaved. When our Saviour Chriſt was diſcovering the difficultie of the way to Salvation; His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſaid, <hi>Good Lord, who then ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So, the poore Soule ſaith? Oh the meanes that I have had, and the prayers that I have made; So that I have thought the heavens did even ſhake againe, and yet, Good Lord, my heart did never ſtirre at all, and therefore how can I be ſaved? And as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith; <hi>Shame hath eaten up the labours of our fathers, and we lye downe in our ſhame, &amp;c.</hi> They had the meanes of grace, and the ordinances of God, and ſhame hath eaten up all, and where are their Temples, and Priviledges now? Shame hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them to nothing. So, it is with a poore feeble
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18422:34"/>
fainting Soule, he ſaith, ſhame hath eaten up all my labours, I have laboured in prayer, in hearing, and in faſting; yet I have no pardon ſealed, nor no mercy granted, I am as much troubled as ever; I ſee as much evill as ever I did; hell is gaping for mee, and ſo ſoone as life is gone from my body; the divell will have my Soule. This is the nature of deſpaire, to put an impoſſibilitie in the thing that it deſpaires of: and to ſay, can it be? and will it be? and will it ever be? Nay, it is impoſſible, for ought I know. Where is the man now, that thought it an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to goe to heaven, he is in an other minde, and his heart is of an other frame; now he hath found by woefull experience, that there is no hope, nor helpe in himſelfe nor in the creature.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond Triall.</note> this followes from the former diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit; the Soule is reſtleſſe, and remaines unſatisfied in what he hath, and what he doth. The heart cannot be ſupported, and therefore it growes to be marveilouſly troubled, and it is not able to ſtay it ſelfe. There is nothing that can ſatisfie the Soule of a man, but it muſt be ſome good. No man is ſatisfied with evill, but rather more troubled with it. It muſt be ſome good, either in hand, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion, or elſe in expectation of ſome good that he may have, and he ſaith, it may be, and it will be. But, when he ſeeth the emptineſſe of all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and the weakeneſſe of all his duties; when theſe failes, his heart and all muſt needs ſinke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth no other good, but them for the while. As it is with the building of a houſe, if the bottome and foundation be brittle, and rotten, and begin to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18422:35"/>
ſhake all the whole building muſt needs ſhake: So, the Soule that ſought for comfort, mercy, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from his outward priviledges and duties; when all theſe begin to ſhake under him, and to breake in ſunder, and he ſeeth no helpe thereby, and that it can receive no eaſe therein; hence it is, that Soule (thus troubled and deſpairing) is in ſuch an eſtate, that if all the Miniſters under heaven ſhould come to flatter him, and to daube him up with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered mortar, and perſwade him of Gods mercy towards him; Take this man upon his death-bed, when all the Miniſters come to give him comfort upon any termes, and they ſay unto him, your courſe hath beene good and commendable, and you have lived thus, and thus; and taken much paines in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing, and faſting; therefore undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you cannot but receive mercy from the Lord. See what the poore Soule will reply: It is true (ſaith he) I have done, and may doe all theſe, but I have not done them in a right manner. I have not had an eye to Chriſts mercy; but have accounted theſe duties, as ſatisfactory to Gods juſtice, ſo that they ſavour not ſo much of dutie, as arrogancy; whileſt preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon their worth: I have not depended upon Gods mercy; but even challenged his juſtice in the reward of my labours. Thus the Soule argueth with it ſelfe, I have depended too long upon theſe outward works, and thought to purchaſe heaven by them, but now I finde it neceſſary, that I get them dyed, and ſanctified in the blood of Chriſt. Thus it was with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaid;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe?</hi> What might ſome ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> You are a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18422:35"/>
reverend learned man, and have had a great name in the Church, and who can ſay, blacke is your eye. It is true, (ſaith he) I know nothing by my ſelfe? but what then, yet I am not thereby juſtified. Nay, it is the difference that he makes betweene himſelfe a Phariſee, and himſelf a poore contrite ſinner. When he was a Phariſee he counted his priviledges gaine to him; but now <hi>hee thought them loſſe in regard of Chriſt.</hi> They are good mercies,<note place="margin">Phil, 3.7.</note> where God gives them in regard of themſelves, but in the way of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and Salvation, they are as dung and droſſe in reſpect of any merit in them. This is one difference betweene a dead hypocrite, and a living Chriſtian. A dead hypocrite will be content with dead hearing, and dead praying, and with the bare ſhell of duties, but, a living Chriſtian that ſeeth his owne evill, and ſinne; cannot be fild nor contented without a Chriſt. That which will maintaine a Camelion, will ſtarve a man; for a Camelion will live upon the ayre? but, put a Man into the beſt ayre that is, and it will ſtarve him, if hee have no other food. So, if thou canſt feed upon the ayre of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the picture, and ſhadow of praying; it is a ſigne thou art a dead man; whereas if thou be a true man in Chriſt Ieſus, thou muſt have bread, or elſe all the world cannot content thee. Bread for the Lords ſake, (ſaith the hunger-ſtarved man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let mee give thee an Item this way; goe thy way home, and take notice of thine heart, thou that canſt licke thy Soule whole, and cure all thy ſinnes with a few prayers, and teares, and faſtings, and in the meane time ſeeſt not a neceſſity of a Saviour,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18422:36"/>
know that it is a notorious ſigne of a cunning hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, as there are many in theſe dayes. It is with an hypocrite, as it is with ſome men written of in Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they have ſuch an antidote, and preſervative, that they can eate poyſon, and it ſhall never hurt them: So it is with ſome hypocrites, that have their reſervations of ſome ſins, and they retaine ſome baſe diſtempers, and they will tipple in a corner, and lye in ſome ſecret ſinnes, and yet they truſt ſo much to their antidote, and to their duties, that it will cure all, and it is but praying, and faſting ſo much the more often. The God of heaven open the eyes, and awaken the conſciences of all ſuch, if there be any ſuch here this day. If it be ſo that thou canſt pray, and keepe a cloſe hollow heart, and thou canſt licke thy ſelfe whole, and then ſinne, and a little prayer will ſerve againe; and then goe, and be unjuſt, and uncleane, and keepe falſe ballances ſtill, know then, it is certaine thou never haddeſt a part in Chriſt, and didſt ſee a need of Chriſt. And as it was with the Prodigall: if hee had beene a Hogge, the huskes might have ſerved him; but hee was a Man, and therefore muſt have bread. Therefore thou hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite to thy Stye, if theſe huskes will ſave thee, and ſerve thy turne, and if the mill of a prayer will ſerve, (I doe not diſcommend theſe duties: No, curſed be he that doth it) but if thou content thy ſelfe with a mill of praying, and yet there is as much power of Chriſt, and ſap of grace in thy heart, as in a chip, then (I ſay) thou art a Hogge and no Man, whom theſe huskes will content.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third Triall.</note>Thirdly, he that ſeeth himſelfe helples and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18422:36"/>
in the meanes, hee will conſtantly labour to goe beyond all the meanes. Becauſe hee is in neede and finds no helpe here, he will ſeeke it els where that his heart may be refreſhed, when the Lord hath awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart and ſhewed him the emptineſſe of all meanes, it makes the ſoule go further then the means: this is the heavenly skill. It is with the Soule in this caſe as it is with a marriner; though his hand be upon the oare, yet he ever lookes homeward to the haven where he would be. And it is in profeſſing as it is in trading. You know when a man ſets up for himſelfe and would live of his calling, hee will buy and ſell, but his eye is ever upon the gaine, thats it which muſt keepe the Cart on the wheeles, or els hee may die a begger and ſhall never be able to keep him and his; it is not enough to trade and to buy and ſell, but he goes beyond all theſe, and labours to get ſomething. Iuſt ſo it is in profeſſing; it is like thy trading, thou heareſt and praieſt, and profeſſeſt, but the gaine is to haue Chriſt made to thee in life and death gaine; ſoe that, all the gaine a man gets is Chriſt. Thou art a profeſſor, and haſt beene bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and haſt received the Sacrament, but, what haſt thou gotten by all thy praying, and preaching, and other ſervices? unleſſe thou haſt gotten Chriſt, thou haſt gotten juſt nothing at all. It is with thee as it is with a man that hath a great ſhop, and much wares, and quicke returne, and yet he is not able to pay his debts: ſo thou performeſt many faire duties, and haſt many rich priviledges, and yet thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfie Gods Iuſtice; nor to recompence the Church for the wrong done to it, and when thou art
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18422:37"/>
going the way of all fleſh, but ſpecially in the day of judgement, then ſhall people ſay of thee, ſuch a man was buying, and ſelling, and profeſſing all his life and yet got nothing; and when a poore Soule is breathing out his laſt, then comes juſtice, and ſaith, give me my own, thou haſt ſinned, and therfore thou muſt die for it, Lord (ſaith hee) take ſome prayers, and readings, and faſtings, in ſtead of payment, and if theſe will not ſerve, then he is blanke, and juſtice carries him downe to the place of execution, and he ſhall not come thence till he have paid the utmoſt farthing. And then the Soule ſaith, ſome comfort, ſome mercy and conſolation for mee; oh ſaith he, I have received the Sacrament, and prayed and faſted, and profeſſed, canſt thou not feede of theſe? oh no! (ſaith the Soule) theſe are huskes, bread for me as the world thinkes of a man that hath got nothing by his trading, ſuch a man that made wonderfull ſhew in the world to day; ſo many hundreths, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands worſe then nothing, this is lamentable. Iuſt ſo it will be with thee, if thou haſt not gotten Chriſt. If a man have gotten Chriſt in his hearing, and praying? hee will anſwer all eaſily, and when the divell comes in, and ſaith? Thou haſt many ſinnes who ſhall ſatisfie Gods Iuſtice for them? The Soule makes this anſwer; Chriſt hath paid all. Oh, but thou haſt broken the Law of God (ſaith the divell). Oh (ſaith the Soule) Chriſt hath fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for mee. You have many corruptions (ſaith the divell; but Chriſt hath purged mee (ſaith the Soule). Oh, but you ſhall be damned (ſaith the divell to him: Nay, (ſaith the Soule) there is no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18422:37"/>
condemnation to them that are in Chriſt, but I am in Chriſt, and therefore ſhall not be damned. Thus the divel ſhall goe away aſhamed, and ſay, That man is out of my reach, I ſhall never get him downe to hell, he hath gotten Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But here this queſtion may be asked,<note place="margin">Queſtion.</note> how may a man goe beyond himſelfe in all his duties?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Becauſe this is a skill above all skills, therefore for the anſwer hereof take theſe three directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> labour to ſee an abſolute neceſſity of a Chriſt in all theſe priviledges that thou haſt, and in all the duties and ſervices that thou performeſt. Firſt, in all thy priviledges. See a need of Chriſt to make all theſe powerfull to thy Soule. Hearing, and reading, and faſting, will doe thee no good, except thou have a Chriſt to goe with all theſe. As a Ship that hath faire Sailes, &amp; ſtrong Maſts, except there be a winde it can never goe. So, the Soule is like the Ship; and the precious ordinances of God are faire Sailes and good Maſts; and it is good hearing, and good read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and good faſting, but except the Spirit blowe with theſe, thou canſt get no good by them: the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, and except the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by the power of his Spirit, go &amp; breath upon thy hearing, Preaching, and upon all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they can doe thee no good. When the Lord was to come into his Garden, which was the Church. The Spices are the graces of Gods Spirit. The Spices could not growe, becauſe the Spirit would not blowe upon them, and therefore the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>Ariſe oh North,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 4.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and come (oh South) and blowe on my Garden, that the Spices thereof may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18422:38"/>
flowe out,</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, Good Lord, blowe this way, and that way, and give a bleſſing to the meanes, and then comfort will come indeed. And as there is need of Chriſt to bleſſe all meanes, ſo ſecondly there is need of Chriſt to make all thy ſervices acceptable to God the Father. Oh ſend to heaven for a Chriſt, that he may hide all thy weakneſſes, and preſent all thy duties to God his Father, in his merits and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. They that brought a Sacrifice in the time of the Law, were to offer it upon the golden Altar, and no Sacrifice was accepted without it: So, if thou wilt have thy hearing, and praying, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptable to God, lay them upon the golden Altar, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And know that thou haſt need of Chriſt to cover all the failings &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in thy duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Direction.</note>Secondly, In all the beautie and excellencie of Gods ordinances that thou ſeeſt and prizeſt. See a greater beautie and excellencie in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then in all theſe. See what comfort it is that thou wouldeſt finde, and what ſweet is it that thou wouldeſt get from hearing, and reading, praying, and profeſſing; goe beyond all this, and ſay, if the beames be ſo ſweet, what is the Sunne it ſelfe, and if the ordinances of God be ſo ſweet and comfortable, what is the Lord Ieſus Chriſt then. You come to heare, and it is well that you will come? What would you have in hearing? You would have ſome life to quicken you, and ſome wiſedome in your mindes to direct you, and ſome grace into your Soules to purge you; and then mee thinks I heare you ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord this day, I found my
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18422:38"/>
heart ſomething more quickned, and my Soule ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inabled to hate ſinne, and to walke with God; bleſſe God for that. But, is a little life in the word ſo good, and is a little grace in the Sacrament ſo ſweet, Oh then away, away higher, if theſe be ſo ſweet, what is the Lord Ieſus the God of all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, grace, and power. If the Word doe ſo much quicken thy Soule, what would the Lord Ieſus doe, if thou couldeſt get thy heart poſſeſſed of him. Let all theſe drops of life and mercie draw up thy heart to heaven. When the Spouſe in the Canticles had ſought after her beloved, ſee how ſhe deſcribes him,<note place="margin">Can. 5.10.16.</note>
                  <hi>his mouth is white and ruddie,</hi> and ſo forth, and in the 16. verſe ſhee ſaith, <hi>Hee is moſt ſweet, yea, hee is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely.</hi> The originall hath it, he is altogether pleaſant, yea, pleaſantneſſe it ſelfe. You have ſome comfort, and ſome diſcomfort with it, you have ſome wiſedome, and ſome folly, ſome power, and ſome weakneſſe with it, but the Lord Ieſus is all comfort, and no diſcomfort, he is all power, and no weakneſſe, he is all life, and no deadneſſe, therefore in all the ordinances of God, carrie your hearts a little higher, and looke upon that fulneſſe that is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us labour in the uſe of all meanes,<note place="margin">The third meanes.</note> as to ſee the beauty of a Chriſt ſurpaſſing all meanes, ſo let us be led by all meanes into a neerer union with the Lord Chriſt. As a wife deales with the letters of her husband that is in a farre Country, ſhe findes many ſweet inklings of his love, and ſhee will read theſe letters often, and daily, ſhee would talke with her husband a farre off, and ſee him in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18422:39"/>
Oh (ſaith ſhee) thus and thus he thought when he writ theſe lines, and then ſhee thinks hee ſpeakes to her againe; ſhee reads theſe letters onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee would be with her husband a little, and have a little parlee with him in his pen, though not in his preſence: ſo theſe ordinances are but the Lords love-letters, and wee are the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt; and though wee are poore ſottiſh ignorant men, yet wee bring mervailous good newes that Chriſt can ſave all poore broken hearted ſinners in the world.</p>
               <p>You doe well to come and heare, but it is all that you may chat and parlee a little with Chriſt. Our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Where the carkaſſe or the dead body is, there will the Eagles be.</hi> This is the nature of an Eagle, ſhee will not goe to catch flies, (that's the nature of the hedge Sparrow,) but ſhee will prey upon the carkaſſe. So, this is a good heart that will not prey upon dead duties, but upon the Lord Chriſt, who is the life of the Soule. If thou art of a right brood, thou wilt not fill and glut thy Soule with a few duties like a hedge Sparrow; ſtill, miſtake me not, I doe not diſpraiſe theſe duties, but (I ſay) they are nothing in the way of juſtification: if faith in Chriſts merits be not joyned with them. Therefore if thou haſt a dunghill heart of thine owne, thou may'ſt goe and content thy ſelfe with profeſſion, and with a few cold dead duties, but if thou art an Eagle, and a ſound hearted Chriſtian, and one, that God hath beene pleaſed to doe good unto: thou wilt never be but where the Lord Ieſus is, and where his grace and mercy is. As we doe at a Feaſt; the diſh is greater
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18422:39"/>
then the meat, yet wee reach the diſh (not for the diſhes ſake) but that we may cut ſome meat: So, the ordinances of God, are as ſo many diſhes, wherein the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is diſhed out to us. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Chriſt in his merits, is diſhed out in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the ſences, and ſometimes he is diſhed out in the Word; therefore as you take the diſh to cut ſome meate: So, take the Word; that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates Chriſt to the eare, and Prayer Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with Chriſt, and the Sacrament Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates Chriſt to all the ſences; cut the meate, and let not the Lord Chriſt goe whole from the Table, and no man looke after him, fill your hungry Soules with Chriſt. When a poore travelling man comes to the Ferry; he cryes to the other ſide; Have over, have over; his meaning is, he would goe to the other ſide by a Boat; he onely deſires the uſe of the Ferry-man to convey him over. So, Chriſt is in heaven, but we are here on earth (as it were) on the other ſide of the river; the ordinances of God are but as ſo many Boats to carry us, and to land us at Heaven where our hopes are; and our hearts ſhould be. Therefore you would be landed: Have over, have over (ſaith the Soule). The Soule deſires to bee landed at the Staires of Mercy, and ſaith, Oh, bring me to ſpeake with my Saviour. <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Sepulchre to ſeeke for Chriſt, and therefore when the Angel ſaid to her, <hi>Woman why weepest thou,</hi> ſhee made this anſwer, <hi>Oh, they have taken away my Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.13.</note> So, it is with you, if you be not hypocrites. Is there ever a <hi>Mary</hi> here? is there ever a man or woman that prizeth a Chriſt, and ſeeth need of a Chriſt, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18422:40"/>
that comes weeping and mourning to the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God? whom ſeekeſt thou (ſaith the Word, and Prayer, and the Sacrament? Oh (ſaith the broken hearted ſinner) they have taken away my Lord Chriſt? Oh this ſinfull heart of mine; oh theſe curſed corruptions of mine! if it had not beene for theſe, Chriſt would have comforted my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and pardoned my ſinne; if thou ſeeſt my Chriſt and my Saviour; reveale him to my Soule, that I may receive comfort and conſolation by him. This is the frame of a Chriſtian Soule: when the Ferry-man hath carried the traveller over, hee ſtayes not there, but goes to the houſe of his friend, and ſaith, is ſuch a man within, he deſires to ſpeake with him, and to receive ſome good from him. We heare, and pray, and reade till we are weary, we doe not cry; Have over, let mee come to enjoy a neerer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with my Saviour, that I may dwell with him, and have a neerer cut to the Lord Chriſt; I would have way, that I may receive grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from Chriſt according to my neceſſities. When a man hath gotten ſo many hundreth pounds, he not onely tels that he hath met with the Ferry-man, but he ſhewes the money that he hath gotten. So, you come to Church, and goe from Church, and you have your hearing, for your hearing: and your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, for your profeſſing and the like; but you ſhould labour to ſay; I have gotten the pardon of all my ſinnes, and the aſſurance of Gods love to my Soule; I have beene with my Saviour, and thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, and mercifully hee hath dealt with mee. All that I have ſaid, is but a ſpeech of a little time, but it is a taske for all a mans life. Oh thinke of it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18422:40"/>
and ſay, what have I gotten by all that I have done? and what would I get when I goe to prayer? I would have a Chriſt and mercy from him. This is not in our minds. I tell thee what thou muſt ayme at, and labour for, heare, and pray for a Saviour. See a need of Chriſt in all, and ſee greater beauty in Chriſt then in all, and be lead neerer to Chriſt by all, or elſe you get nothing by all that you doe. If there were no gold in the Weſt-Indies, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> would not care for his Ships, nor for that place. Schoole-boyes care not for the Carrier, but for Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from a Father. So, now raiſe up your hearts higher towards heaven: All holy duties are but as Ships, and Carriers, but the golden Mines of mercy are all in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. It was a ſweet ſpeech of a man (whether he was good or bad I know not) that a man ſhould looſe the creatures in God. So, I would have you doe, looſe your ſelves, and all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and creatures, and all that you have and doe, in the Lord Chriſt. How is that? Let all be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and let nothing be ſeene but a Chriſt, and let thy heart be ſet upon nothing but a Chriſt. As it is with the Moone and Starres, when the Sunne comes, they looſe all their light, though they are there in the heavens ſtill; and as it is with rivers, they all goe into the Sea, and are all ſwallowed up of the Sea: and yet there is nothing ſeene but the Sea. So, all the ordinances, and creatures, are as ſo many rivers from that Ocean of mercy and goodneſſe in Chriſt, and they all returne thither; therefore onely ſee a Fountaine of grace, goodneſſe, wiſedome, and power in Chriſt: When a man is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18422:41"/>
upon the Sea, he can ſee no freſh water, it is all ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up: So, let it be with thy Soule, when thou wouldeſt finde mercy and grace. The ordinances of God are good in themſelves, yet looſe them all in Chriſt. That wiſedome in Chriſt is able to direct, and that grace and mercy in Chriſt is able to ſave, when all other helps faile, and that power of Chriſt muſt ſupport the Soule in the time of trouble. There is ſome comfort and ſweet, and ſome refreſhing in the Word, and in the Sacrament, and in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods people; but looſe all theſe in the Lord Chriſt. And ſee that mercy, and compaſſion, and that boundleſſe goodneſſe that is in the Lord Ieſus; and that mercy that will pardon all ſinnes, and forgive all ſorts of ſinners, if they be humbled before him. There is no pardon in grace, nor in means, in Word, nor in Sacraments, there is none but in Chriſt, ſee none but that, and when thou art there, hold thy heart to it; drench and drowne thy Soule there, and fling thy Soule into the Sea of that plenteous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Chriſt; and though thy prayers and all faile, yet that mercy in Chriſt will never faile. Away with theſe rivers, theſe are all freſh water comforts that will faile, but that Sea of mercy in Chriſt will hold for ever. See a Sea of miſery and confuſion in thy ſoule, and a Sea of mercy in Chriſt, and ſay, none but that Lord; Here ſit, and here fall, and for ever eſtabliſh thy ſoule, that it may goe well with thee for ever. Thus you ought to goe beyond all meanes, and he that doth thus, doth truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of all ſaving ſuccour in them. Therefore goe home, and ſay thus, the Lord hath given mee ſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18422:41"/>
comfort, and ſome grace, and a heart enlarged to walke with God, and to performe dutie to him, but I truſt not in this comfort, nor in my enlargement, all my comfort is in Chriſt, that Sea of mercy is ſtill full, and I reſt there; go from all theſe to that, and reſt there and let that content thee for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how farre the Prodigall hath gone.<note place="margin">Text.</note> What doth he now? he comes to himſelfe and ſaith, <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my Father, and ſay to him Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne, make mee as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> Now his ſtout ſtomacke is come downe, and he comes home by weeping croſſe, and he that had formerly ſlighted the kindneſſe of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid, Hee would not alwayes be holden within his fathers houſe, he would have his portion, and he hath it, and is gone, and at laſt when his heart and all failes him, he comes to himſelfe &amp; ſaid, here I may ſtarve and die too, the hogges fare better then I do, therefore home I will go to my father &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Firſt, he ſubmits himſelfe to his father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is content to be at his fathers diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; he doth not ſeeke to be his owne carver, and ſay, if I may be my fathers ſteward, and have ſome eminent place in the houſe, then I will go home, no, but he ſaith, father, I am not worthy to be a Sonne, make mee as a hired ſervant, if I can but get into my fathers houſe againe; I will die rather then go away any more: he is content to be any thing, ſo his father

will but receive him into his family, though it were but to be a drudge in the kitchen, heres a heart worth gold, oh! (ſaith he) let all the weight lye upon me I care not what I be, only let mee be a ſervant. So then from the former of theſe two, the Doctrine is this.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note>The firſt, how the Soule behaves it ſelfe in this ſubjection. The ſinner having a ſight of his owne ſin and being troubled and overwhelmed with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable ſorrow that attends there unto, and yet he is not able to get power over his ſinne, nor aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pardon from the Lord; for you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſinner to bee in the worke of preparation, and hee yet conceives God to bee an enemy againſt him, though he is in a good way to mercy, yet God comes as an angry God againſt him, and hee takes what courſe he can and ſeekes far and wide, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves all meanes and takes up all dutyes, that (if it were poſſible) he might heale his wounded Soule, and get ground againſt his corruptions, but the truth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18422:42"/>
is, hee finds no ſuccour and receives no comfort in what he hath, nor in what he doth, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this deſpairing condition; he ſeeth he cannot avoyd Gods anger, neither can he beare it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is forced (though loath) to make triall of the kindneſſe of a father, and of the Lord, though for the preſent he apprehends God to be juſt &amp; to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, and though hee hath no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods favour for the while, and no certainty how he ſhall ſpeed if hee come to God; yet becauſe he ſees that he cannot be worſe then hee is, but hee may be better if God pleaſe, and this he knowes that none but God can helpe him: therefore he fals at the footeſtoole of mercy, and lyes grovelling at the gate of grace, and ſubmits himſelfe to God that he may do what he will with him. When Ionah had denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that heavy judgement and (as it were) throwne wild-fire about the ſtreets, ſaying,<note place="margin">Ionah 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>within fortie dayes Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> See what they reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they faſted, and prayed, and put on ſack cloath and aſhes; the Lord in mercy grant that we may take the like courſes, <hi>who can tell</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>but God may turne and repent him of his feirce wrath that we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not.</hi> As if they had ſaid, we know not what God will do, but this wee know that we cannot oppoſe Gods judgements, nor prevent them, nor ſuccour our ſelves: yet who can tell but the Lord may bee gratious and bountifull, and yet continue peace and goodneſſe to us in this kind; thus it is with a ſinner deſpairing of all ſuccour in himſelfe, when he ſeeth hell fire flaſhing in his face, and that he cannot ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour himſelfe, then he ſaith, this I know that all the

meanes in the world cannot ſave mee, yet who can tell but the Lord may have mercy upon mee, and cure this diſtreſſed conſcience and heale all theſe wounds that ſinne hath made in my Soule: when Paule went breathing out threatnings againſt the Church of God, and he came furniſhed with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the high Prieſts, with all his tricks and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements to perſecute the Saints; the Lord met him and there was a ſingle combat fought between them, the glory of the Lord amazed him, and threw him flat on the ground, and when Paul ſaw that the Lord Ieſus had the advantage againſt him, hee yeilded himſelfe and ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord what wilt thou have mee to do.</hi> This is the lively picture of the Soule in this caſe; this ſubjection diſcovers it ſelfe in foure particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, take the Soule deſpairing of mercy and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in himſelfe, hee ſeeth and confeſſeth that the Lord may and (for ought he knowes) will proceed in juſtice againſt him, and execute upon him thoſe plagues that God hath threatned, and his ſinne deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and he ſeeth that Iuſtice is not yet ſatisfied, and all thoſe reckonings betweene God and him are not made up, and therefore he cannot apprehend but that God may and will take vengeance of him; he ſeeth that when he hath done all that he can, he is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and Iuſtice remaines unſatisfied, and ſaith, thou haſt ſinned, and I am wronged, and therefore thou ſhalt dye. See what the text ſaith, <hi>can a man be profitable to the Lord;</hi> as he that is wiſe may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelfe,<note place="margin">Iob 22.2, 3.</note> is it any pleaſure to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that thou art righteous, or is it any gaine to him that thou makeſt thy way perfect. So the Soule
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18422:43"/>
ſaith; Is all that I can doe any thing to the Lord, is the Lords Iuſtice any gainer by it? Nay, Iuſtice is yet unſatisfied, becauſe there is ſinne in all that I doe, and therefore Iuſtice may proceed againſt me: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule reſolves, that the Lord may and will: Nay, why ſhould he not come in vengeance, and Iudgement againſt him?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he conceives that what God will doe,   he can doe, and he cannot avoyd it. The anger of the Lord cannot be reſiſted; If the Lord will come and require the glory of his Iuſtice againſt him, there is no way to avoyd it, nor to beare it, and this cruſheth the heart, and makes the ſoule to be beyond all ſhifts, and evaſions, and all thoſe tricks, whereby it may ſeeme to avoyd the dint of the Lords blow. As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee is one minde and who can turne him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 23.13, 14, 15, 16.</note>
                  <hi>and what his ſoule deſireth that doth he.</hi> It is admirable to conſider it: for this is it that makes the heart melt and come under; When the Soule ſaith, If God come who can turne him, hee will have his honour from this wretched proud heart of mine, hee will have his glory from mee, either here in my humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe hereafter in my damnation. And in the next verſe, <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Many ſuch things are with him:</hi> As if he had ſaid, hee hath many wayes to cruſh a carnall confident heart, and to make it lye low, He wants not meanes to pull downe even the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinner under heaven. And now marke what followes, He can cruſh them all; what became of <hi>Nimrod, Cain, Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> They are all brought downe; therefore (ſaith he) I am troubled at his preſence, when I conſider it I am
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18422:44"/>
afraid, for God maketh my heart ſoft, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie troubleth mee.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, As the ſinner apprehends, that God may doe what he will and he cannot reſiſt him; So the ſoule flings away all ſhifts and tricks that he had, and he reſignes up the power of all his priviledges that he hath to defend himſelfe withall; he caſts away his weapons, and falles downe before the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes himſelfe into the Soveraigne power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. This was in the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.25.26.</note> When the Lord had caſt him out of his Kingdome, hee ſaid to <hi>Zadock; Carry backe the Arke of God into the Citie, if I ſhall finde favour in the eyes of the Lord, hee will bring mee backe againe, and ſhew mee both it and his habitation. But if he thus ſay to mee, I have no delight in thee, Behold, here I am, let him doe with mee as ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi> Or as it was with thoſe people,<note place="margin">2 King. 10.2.3, 4.</note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.2, 3, 4. Where when <hi>Iehu</hi> ſent this meſſage to the people of Iſrael, ſaying, <hi>Now as aſſoone as this letter commeth to you, ſeeing your maſters ſonnes are with you, and there are with you chariots, and armour, and a fenced Citie, looke out even the beſt and fitteſt of your maſters ſonnes, and ſet him on his fathers throne, and fight for your fathers houſe.</hi> But the text ſaith, <hi>they were all exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and therefore they ſent word to</hi> Iehu and ſaid, <hi>two Kings could not ſtand out againſt thee, and then how can we ſtand? We are thy ſervants, and will doe all that thou ſhalt bid us, wee will make no King, doe thou that which is good in thine eyes.</hi> This is the frame of a poore Soule: When a poore ſinner will ſtand upon his own priviledges, the Lord ſaith, beare my Iuſtice, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18422:44"/>
defend thy ſelfe by all that thou haſt if thou canſt; and the Soule ſaith, I am thy ſervant (Lord) doe what is good in thine eyes, I cannot ſuccour my ſelf: therefore the heart gives up it ſelfe to be at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The Soule thus yielding up the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and comming in as to an enemy, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,   then in the laſt place the ſoule freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that it is in Gods power to doe with him, and to diſpoſe of him as he will; and therefore he lyes and lickes the duſt, and cryes mercy, mercy Lord. He doth not thinke to purchaſe mercy at the Lords hands, but onely ſaith; it is onely in Gods good pleaſure to doe with him as he will, but hee lookes at his favour and cryes, mercy (Lord) to this poore diſtreſſed ſoule of mine. And when the Lord heares a ſinner come from wandring up and downe in his priviledges, the Lord replyes to the ſoule in this manner and ſaith. Doeſt thou need mercy? I had thought thy hearing, and praying, and faſting, would have carried thee to heaven without all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, therefore gird up thy loynes, and make thy ferventeſt prayers, and let them meet my Iuſtice, and ſee if they can beare my wrath and purchaſe mercy; Nay (ſaith the ſinner) I know it by lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I have prooved, that all my prayers and performances, will never procure peace to my ſoule, nor give any ſatisfaction to thy Iuſtice, I onely pray for mercy, and I deſire onely to heare ſome newes of mercy, to relieve this miſerable and wretched ſoule of mine; it is onely mercy that muſt helpe me; Oh mercy, if it may be poſſible: the iſſue is thus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18422:45"/>
much; The ſinner ſeeth that all he hath, and can do, can never ſuccour him, and therefore he throwes away his carnall confidence, and he ſubmits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Lord; and now he ſeeth that the Lord may juſtly come againſt him, and that his juſtice is not ſatisfied, and that he cannot beare Gods wrath, nor avoyd it, and he caſts away all his ſhifts, and lyes downe at the gate of mercy. As it is with a debtor that ſtands bound for ſome farre greater ſummes, then ever he is able to pay; to ſatisfie of himſelfe he cannot, and his friends will not: and he knowes that the bonds are ſtill in force and his creditor will ſue him; avoyd the ſuit he cannot, and to beare it, he is not able; and therefore he comes in freely, and offers himſelfe, and his perſon, and gives up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his creditors hands, onely he beſeecheth him to remit that which he can never pay. Iuſt ſo it is with the ſoule of a poore ſinner. The Soule is the Debtor: and Divine Iuſtice is the Creditor. When the poore ſinner hath uſed all meanes to ſave and ſuccour himſelfe, and to make payment, and he hath (as it were) made a gathering of prayers all the Countrey over, and yet he ſeeth, that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betweene God and him; and yet his ſinne is not pardoned: and God is Iuſt and will have his honour, and he is not able to avoyd the ſuite nor to beare it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.7, 8.</note> and the Soule ſaith, as <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy ſpirit? and whither ſhall I flye from thy preſence? if I aſcend up into heaven thou art there, &amp;c.</hi> So the Soule ſaith, God will have his payment from this heart blood of mine, if I goe into the Eaſt the Lord will follow mee; and bid his Serjeant
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18422:45"/>
Conſcience to arreſt mee, and I ſhall lye and rot in the Priſon of hell for ever. Now the Soule offers himſelfe before the Lord, and ſaith, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee:</hi> Oh ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (if it be poſſible) to this poore diſtreſſed Soule of mine: thus the Prodigall did. An other Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is this. Me thinks the picture of thoſe foure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed Lepers, may fitly reſemble this poore ſinner. When the famine was great in Samaria:<note place="margin">2 King. 7.3.8, 9, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>There were foure leprous men ſate in the gate of the Citie, and they ſaid, Why ſit we here untill we die? If wee enter into the Citie, the famine is there, and if we ſit here wee dye alſo; Now let us therefore fall into the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if they ſave us alive we ſhall live, and if they kill us we ſhall but die.</hi> They had but one meanes to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour themſelves withall, and that was to goe into the Campe of their enemies, come (ſaid they) we will put it to the venture, and ſo they did, and were relieved: This is the lively picture of a poore ſinner in this deſpairing condition. When the Soule of a poore Leprous ſinner is famiſhed for want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and hee ſeeth the wrath of God purſuing of him, and the Lord beſets him on every ſide: at laſt he reſolves thus with himſelfe, I ſay, when he hath uſed all meanes, and finds ſuccour in none; hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves thus with himſelfe and ſaith, if I goe and reſt upon my priviledges, there is nothing but empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakeneſſe if I truſt in them, and if I reſt in my naturall condition, I periſh there alſo. Let mee therefore fall into the hands of the Lord of Hoſts, who (I confeſſe) hath beene provoked by mee, and for ought I ſee is mine enemy, I am now a damned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18422:46"/>
man, and if the Lord caſt me out of his preſence, I can but be damned that way, and then hee comes to the Lord, and falls downe before the footſtoole of a conſuming God, and ſaith as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>What ſhall I ſay unto thee oh thou preſerver of men?</hi> I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to plead for my ſelf withall, and I have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuccour my ſelfe, my accuſations are my beſt excuſe, all the priviledges in the world cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, and all my duties cannot ſave me, if there be any mercy left, Oh ſuccour a poore diſtreſſed ſinner in the very gall of bitterneſſe. This is the behaviour of the Soule in this work of ſubjection.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Lord deales thus with the Soule, and why hee plucks a ſinner upon his knees; there is great reaſon why he ſhould doe it. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is two-fold. Firſt, That the Lord may herein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and glorifie the greatneſſe of his power.

Firſt, in that the Lord helps a poore ſinner at a dead lift, and when all prayers, and hearings prevailed not, and when all priviledges were not able to purchaſe mercy and favour, then the Lord ſhewes mercy. Doth not this argue the excellencie of that Balme? that will cure when all other meanes cannot doe the deede, that the Lord ſhould then (I ſay) looke upon a poore ſinner, and refreſh him with one drop of mercy: Oh, this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercy! As the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>All my bones can ſay, Lord, who is like unto thee?</hi> as if hee had ſaid, This eye that hath wept for my ſinnes, this tongue that hath confeſt my ſinnes, and this heart that hath grieved for ſinne, all theſe have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by thee. This prayer is not like to thee, this faſting and theſe priviledges are not like to thee, for theſe could not ſuccour mee; but thou art the Lord that didſt deliver and ſuccour thy poore ſervant. And ſecondly, herein is alſo admirable freeneſſe of mercy; that when the Lords mercy was but lightly looked after, that then the Lord ſhould give mercy, and that to an enemie. For, the Soule can ſay, if any thing in the world would have ſaved mee, I ſhould not have gone to the Lord for mercy; and yet when all would not doe, and when I did not thinke of any ſuch matter, then the Lord ſaved mee. This is free mercy. The hope of Iſrael is not like others, and the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> is not like other Gods. You diſtreſſed Soules, did not you know the time when God ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified you, and then offered mercy and you would
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18422:47"/>
none, but you would ſcramble for mercy, and ſhift for your owne comfort, and yet the Lord brought downe thoſe proud hearts of yours, and when you were at a dead lift, and could find comfort no where elſe, then did the Lord ſhew mercy to your Soules. Was not this free mercy? wonder at it, and give God glory for it, even for ever.</p>

Oh, you muſt not be drunke, (ſaith one) it is a hot argument, and are you ſuch a childe as to yield to it. No, let us follow our owne wayes; is it not thus? I appeale to your owne Soules: there are too many guiltie in this place? Doe you thinke to out-brave the Almightie in this manner? doe you provoke the Lord to wrath, and doe you not provoke your Soules to your owne confuſion? Doeſt thou thinke to goe to heaven thus bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: the Lord cannot endure thee here, and will Hee ſuffer thee to dwell with himſelfe for ever in heaven? What, thou to heaven upon theſe termes? Nay, thou muſt not thinke to out-brave the Lord in this manner, and to goe to heaven too? How did the Lord deale with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and all thoſe glorious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? He ſent them all downe to hell for their pride. Let all ſuch ſpirits heare, and know their miſery. I doe not trouble my ſelfe with any matter of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it is no trouble to me, but onely becauſe of your ſinnes, for you are the greateſt objects of pitty under heaven.

If the Lord reproves, it takes the ſame home to it ſelfe, if the Lord promiſeth, it beleeves; and if the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, it trembles. It is eaſie to be convinced of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18422:50"/>
it is informed, if it have no good reaſon to gaine-ſay it. It is not of that wayward and pettiſh diſpoſition, that it will not be ſatisfied though all his reaſons be anſwered, and all objections taken away. It is not led by his owne humours, as many a man is, though his conceits be againſt reaſon, and oppoſite againſt God and his grace. Nay, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yeeld to the authority of the truth, and to take the impreſſion of every truth; it heares, and yields,<note place="margin">Iob 34.32.</note> and obeyes, and frames it ſelfe anſwerably. As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which I know not teach thou mee, and if I have done any iniquity, I will doe ſo no more.</hi> The humble Soule is content to confeſſe his ignorance, and to ſubmit to any truth, that may enforme him, and it is content to receive that mercy and grace that is offered, by what meanes ſoever God ſeeth beſt to Communicate it. Nay, the heart that is truly ſubmiſſive, is as willing to take comfort when it is offered upon good grounds, as it is to performe dutie enjoyned. By a fooliſh pettiſhneſſe, the divell withdrawes the hearts of Gods owne people from much comfort, that God hath diſhed out of purpoſe for their benefit. For howſoever the Soule of a poore ſinner be truly touched, yet for want of this lowlineſſe, and this teachableneſſe, and ſubmiſſion it refuſeth, that ſap and ſweet, that it ſhould take and receive from the Lord. Take a poore ſinner, that hath many ſinnes burthening of him, and hee is cruſhed with them, and that in truth he deſires com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but receives none: Let the Miniſter of God come, and anſwer all his arguments, and ſatisfie all his quarrels that he can make, and ſet him on a cleare
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18422:50"/>
boord, and tell him that the work of grace is cleare, and mercy is appointed for him: Now marke how he flyes of through that ſullenneſſe, and untoward peeviſhneſſe and pride of Spirit, hee caſts away the mercy, and yields not to the comfort offered, though he is content to yield to the duties enjoyned, and ſo he deprives himſelfe of that mercy, and comfort that is offered; and thus when all is done time after time, the Soule ſaith, I ſee it not, and I perceive it not: and all the world ſhall not perſwade me of it. Why? what, are you wiſer then all the world? what a pride of heart is this? Oh ſaith he, another man may be cozened and deceived, but I know my owne heart better then any Miniſter doth. But you tell the Miniſter what your condition is, and ſo, what you know hee knowes, and hee hath more judgement to enforme you, then you have of your ſelfe. Then ſaith the Miniſter, all your cavils and objections are anſwered, and remooved; and all that worke of grace that God hath wrought, you have made it knowne and revealed, and all this is made good by the Word of God; now if all theſe quarrels be anſwered, and if all the reaſons and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the worke of grace be made cleare, that you cannot deny them; then, why may not you take comfort? Downe with that proud heart of yours, that will not beleeve whatſoever the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaith. Oh the height of pride, and haughtineſſe of heart in this caſe! I ſpeake to you to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and mercy is impropriated, downe with thoſe proud ſpirits I ſay. It is not becauſe you cannot, but becauſe you will not. It is ſaid in <hi>Eſay, God prepares
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18422:51"/>
the garment of gladneſſe for the ſpirit of heavineſſe.</hi> When the Lord ſeeth the ſoule prepared and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,<note place="margin">Eſa. 61.3.</note> he takes meaſure of it, and diſheth out a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort anſwerable, he prepares a conſolation as fit as may be, and yet the Soule will not put it on, nor be warned and refreſhed with it; as it is with ſome way-ward &amp; untoward childe, who when his father hath prepared a ſuit of cloathes fitting for him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not ſuch and ſuch a lace, hee will not put it on, but throwes all away. Oh, it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pride of ſpirit! a rod, a rod. Even ſo, when the Lord prepares the garment of gladneſſe, you will not put it on, nor receive the comfort that is offered, and ſo ſwelt your owne hearts.</p>
               <p>Now I come to this laſt paſſage in this worke of Humiliation, and this is the dead lift of all. The Prodigall doth not ſtand it out with his Father and ſay, I am now come againe, if I may have halfe the rule in the Family, I am content to live with you. No, though he would not ſtay there before, yet now he cannot be kept out, hee is content to be any thing. Oh (ſaith he) I confeſſe I doe deſerve the worſt, but if any man will once helpe me in, and but throw mee over the threſhold, if I may but Scoure the Kettles, or doe any drudgery, I will never out againe. Oh that I could get in once. As if he had ſaid, you that thinke nothing ſufficient, if you had taſted the bitterneſſe of affliction as I have done, you would be glad of any thing in a Fathers houſe; Come all you drunkards, and adulterers, you will needs away from God, and his grace? I tell you, if you were bitten and troubled as I have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18422:51"/>
beene, then you would ſay, it is good being in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, and it is good yielding to the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any termes: as it was with this Prodigall: So it is with every Soule that is truly humbled with the ſenſe of his owne vileneſſe. When the Soule ſeeth that no duties will quiet his Conſcience, nor get the pardon of his ſinne, he comes home and is content, (not onely to take up the profeſſion of the Goſpel upon ſome agreements with the Lord, and to ſay, if I may have honours, and preferments, and eaſe, and libertie, and the like, then I am content to follow it. Nay, the Soule ſaith, let mee be a miſerable ſlave and impriſoned, let mee be a ſervant, and be brought to the heavieſt hazards, I care not what I be, if the Lord will but receive mee to mercy. Lord (ſaith he) ſhew mee mercy, and if I am content to be, and to ſuffer any thing. So from hence the Doctrine is this.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="doctrine">
               <head>4. <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Soule that is truly humbled, is content to be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by the Almightie, as it pleaſeth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The maine pith of this point lyes in the word, content. This phraſe is a higher pitch then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of ſubmiſſion: and this is plaine by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Take a debtor, who hath uſed all meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the creditor: in the end hee ſeeth that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoyd the ſuit, and to beare it hee is not able. Therefore the onely way is to come in, and yield himſelfe into his creditors hands; where there is nothing, the King muſt looſe his right; ſo the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor yields himſelfe: but ſuppoſe the creditor ſhould uſe him hardly, and exact the uttermoſt, throw him into priſon; Now to be content to under-goe the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18422:52"/>
hardeſt dealing, it is a hard matter: this is a further degree then the offering of himſelfe. So, when the Soule hath offered himſelfe, and he ſeeth that Gods writs are out againſt him, and his Conſcience (the Lords Serjeant) is comming to ſerve a <hi>Subpena</hi> of him, and he is not able to avoyd it, nor to beare it when it comes, therefore he ſubmits himſelfe and ſaith, Lord, whither ſhall I goe, thy anger is heavy and unavoydable; Nay, whatſoever God requires, the Soule layes his hand upon his mouth, and goes away contented and well ſatisfied, and it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt the Lord. This is the nature of the Doctrine in hand: and for the better opening of it, let me diſcover three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, What is the behaviour of the Soule, in this worke of contentedneſſe. Brethren, theſe are paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of great weight, that I would have every man to take notice of.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, What is the behaviour of the Lord, or, what is the diſpoſition wherewith the Soule muſt be contented.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The reaſon why the Lord will have the heart at ſuch an under, and to be at his command? For, howſoever the Lords worke is ſecret in other ordinary things, yet all the Soules that ever came to Chriſt, and that ever ſhall come to Chriſt, muſt have this worke upon them; and it is impoſſible that faith ſhould be in the Soule; except this worke be there firſt, to make way for faith.</p>
               <p>How ſhall a man know when his Soule is thus contented? this frame of heart diſcovers it ſelfe, in three particular acts, or paſſages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18422:52"/>Firſt, You may remember, that I told you before,<note place="margin">Wherein this contentedneſſe conſiſts.</note> that the ſinner was reſolved to yield to God, and to ſubmit himſelfe to his power, and pleaſure, and he did begge mercy. Now the Soule that is truly aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (though he ſeeke mercy) yet hee ſeeth ſo much corruption, and unworthineſſe in himſelfe, that he acknowledgeth himſelfe unfit for mercy. He cannot avoyd the wrath of God, neither can he beare it, therefore he ſaith, Oh mercy, mercy Lord! What (ſaith the Lord) I had thought your owne duties, and prayers, would have carried you out againſt my Iuſtice, and have purchaſed mercy? Oh no (ſaith the Soule) it is onely mercy that muſt relieve and ſuccour mee, but ſuch is my vileneſſe, that I am not fit for the leaſt mercy and favour, and ſuch is the wickedneſſe of this wretched heart of mine, that whatſoever are the greateſt plagues, I am worthy of them all, though never ſo inſupportable: and all the Iudgements that God hath threatned, and prepared for the divell and his angels, they are all due to this wretched Soule of mine, for I am a divell in truth; onely here is the difference, I am not yet in hell: and oh (ſaith the Soule), had the divels the like hopes, and meanes, and patience that I have enjoyed, for ought I know, they would have beene better then I am. It is that which ſhames the Soule in all his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and makes him ſay, had they the like mercy? Oh thoſe ſweet comforts, and thoſe precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that I have had, and that the Lord Ieſus hath made to mee, and hath come ſo many heavy Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes to knocke at my heart, and ſaid, Come to mee yee rebellious children, turne yee, turne yee; why
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18422:53"/>
will yee die. Oh that mercy, that hath followed mee from my houſe to my walke, and there mercy hath conferred with mee, and from thence to my cloſet; and there mercy hath woed mee: and in my night thoughts when I awaked, there mercy kneeled downe before mee, and beſought mee to renounce my baſe courſes, yet I refuſed mercy, and would needs have my owne will; had the divels but ſuch hopes, and ſuch offers of mercy, they that now tremble for want of mercy; they would have given entertainment to it for ought I know: And what, doe I ſeeke for mercy, ſhall I talke of mercy? Alas, ſhall I ſeeke for mercy, when in the meane time, I have thus ſlighted and deſpiſed it; what I mercy? the leaſt of Gods mercies are to good for mee, and the heavieſt of Gods plagues are too little for mee. Nay, the Soule finds no end in pleading, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reaſons thus with himſelfe, and ſaith, that God cannot doe more againſt him then he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but be ſure, he thinkes that God will not lay more upon him then hee is worthy of. Nay, it is ſure the Soule cannot beare nor ſuffer ſo much, as he hath deſerved and pluckt upon himſelfe, if God ſhould proceed in rigour with him. For the ſinner that will deale plainely, and diſcernes his evill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; it is eaſie for him to number up all his abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and the Soule thus reaſons with it ſelfe, and ſaith, I onely deſerve eternall condemnation; for the wages of all ſinne is death, being committed againſt an infinite Majeſtie, and againſt a Divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and then, what doe all theſe my ſinnes deſerve, committed, and continued in, and maintained againſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18422:53"/>
the light of Gods Word, againſt all corrections, and all checks of conſcience, and all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, hell is too good, and ten thouſand hels is to little to torment ſuch a wretch as I am. In truth, I begged mercy, but what, I mercy? I am aſhamed to expect it, and with what heart can I beg this mercy which I have troden under my feet? Shall that blood of Chriſt purge my heart, that blood that I have trampled under my feet, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it as an unholy thing? and when the Lord hath woed mee, and his wounds were bleeding, and his ſides goared, and his hideous cryes comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine eares, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee,</hi> yet this Chriſt have I ſlighted, and made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his blood, and can the blood of Chriſt doe mee any ſervice? indeed I doe crave grace, but how doe I thinke to receive any. All the pillars of the Church can teſtifie, how often grace, and mercy hath beene offered to me, but I have refuſed it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how can I begge any grace? And as the text ſaith, <hi>They ſhall ſee their ſinne and acknowledge their wayes, and Iudge themſelves worthy to be condemned.</hi> So the Soule confeſſeth, that it is worthy of nothing that is good, it is not worthy of Gods love, nor of Gods preſervation nor any other priviledge, only he confeſſeth that he doth loath himſelfe, and ſaith, Oh this ſtubbornneſſe, and villany, and this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe of mine? what I mercy? no I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any, it is more then I can expect, I am onely worthy to be caſt out for ever. As the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>That thou mayeſt remember,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.63.</note> 
                  <hi>and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and never open thy mouth more becauſe of thy

ſhame;</hi> that is, they ſhall remember the evill that they have committed, and the Lords kindneſſe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that they have oppoſed, and they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and not open their mouthes any more. So, now his tongue cleaves to the roofe of his mouth, and he ſaith, I remember my evill, and am aſhamed to expect any mercy, I ſought for mercy before, but now I ſee I am unworthy of any, and worthy of all the judgements that God can poure upon me. The Soule confeſſeth clearely, that hee hath deſerved more then God will lay upon him; for if God ſhould poure all his wrath upon him, he muſt make him infinite to beare his infinite wrath, and therefore the Lord onely layes ſo much upon him as hee is capable of.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Soule acknowledgeth the equalneſſe of Gods dealings be they never ſo harſh in this kind. He confeſſeth that hee is as clay in the hands of the Potter, and the Lord may deale with him as he will. Yea, the Soule is driven to an amazement at the Lords patience, that hee hath beene pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him ſo long, and that God hath not caſt him out of his preſence, and ſent him downe to hell long agoe. It is the frame of Spirit that the poore lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church had,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Lords mercy that wee are not confounded, becauſe his compaſſions faile not.</hi> When a poore drunkard ſeeth how hee hath roared in the Alehouſe againſt God and his truth, and how he hath plotted againſt the Saints, hee wonders that ever God could beare with ſuch a wretch, and that the earth hath not ſwallowed him up quick. And when the Lord hath humbled the heart of an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18422:54"/>
or adultereſſe, hee begins to think thus with himſelfe, the Lord ſaw all the evils that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and all my plottings, and all my inveighings and allurings to this ſinne, and my delight in it: then the Soule admires that ever Gods Iuſtice was able to beare with ſuch a monſter, and that God did not confound him in his burning luſts, and caſt him downe to hell. Oh (ſaith hee) it is becauſe his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies faile not, that my life and all hath not failed long agoe. Nay, the Soule concludes, that the Lord ſhould not ſave him. As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Howbeit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nehem. 9.33.</note>
                  <hi>thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, for thou haſt done right, but wee have done wickedly;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, It is righteous that every man ſhould lye under his owne load, and therefore thou mayeſt juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us. Nay, the Soule ſaith, That God cannot but plague him for ought that hee perceives in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evill, and brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all his works which he doth, becauſe we obeyed not his voyce:</hi> Hee ſpeakes there of the 70. yeares captivity. So the Soule ſaith, Becauſe the Lord is juſt, and righteous, and doth not onely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, but he cannot but puniſh, and therefore he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Lord in all the plagues that ever can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him. And hence it is that the Soule will not maintaine any kinde of murmuring or heart riſing againſt the Lords dealings, much leſſe doth he hide it in the Lord. But, though nature and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſtirring, and ſometimes the heart will be grudging againſt the Lord, and ſay, Why doth the Lord thus, and why are not my prayers anſwered,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18422:55"/>
ſuch a Soule is humbled, and ſuch a Soule is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and why not I as well as hee, yet when any ſuch matter riſeth in the heart, hee ſtifles, cruſheth and chokes theſe wretched diſtempers, and doth abaſe it ſelfe before the Lord, ſaying, <hi>What if God will not</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſpeaking of the rejection of ſome, and the receiving of others: ſo the Soule ſaith, What if God will not heare thy prayers? and what if God will not pacifie thy conſcience? nor ſhew any mercy to thee, thou haſt thy owne, and doth the Lord doe me any wrong, vile hell-hound that I am, I have my ſinne and my ſhame, wrath is my portion, and hell is my place, I may goe thither when I will, it is mercy that God deales thus with me. Now the Soule comes to cleare God in all his providence, and ſaith, It is juſt with God that all the prayers which come from this filthy heart of mine, ſhould be abhorred, and that all my labours in holy duties ſhould never be bleſſed, for I have had theſe ends, and by reſpects in all my duties; it is I that have ſinned againſt checks of conſcience, and againſt knowledge; and therfore it is juſt that I ſhould carry this horror of heart with mee to my grave; it is I that have abuſed mercy, and therefore it is juſt and righteous with God, that I ſhould goe with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting conſcience downe to hell; Oh that (if I be in hell) I might have a Spirit to glorifie and juſtifie thy name there, and ſay, Now I am come downe to hell amongſt you damned creatures, but the Lord is righteous and bleſſed for ever in all his dealings, and I am juſtly condemned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hence the Soule comes to be quiet and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18422:55"/>
frameable under the heavy hand of God in that help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe condition wherein he is; ſo that the Soule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene thus framed aforehand, it comes to this, that it takes the blow and lyes under the burthen and goes away quietly and patiently, hee is quiet and ſaith not a word more: oh! this is a heart worth gold. He accounts Gods dealing and Gods way to bee the fitteſt and moſt reaſonable of all. Oh (ſaith he) it is fit that God ſhould glorifie himſelfe though I be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ever, for I deſerve the worſt; whatſoever I have it is the reward of my owne workes, and the end of my owne way, if I be damned, I may thanke my pride, my ſtubbornneſſe, my peeviſhneſſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and all my baſe corruptions; what, ſhall I repine againſt the Lord becauſe his wrath and his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lyes heavy upon mee? let mee repine againſt my ſinne that made him do it. Let me grudge againſt my baſe heart that hath nouriſhed theſe adders in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſhall I bee unquiet and murmure againſt the Lord becauſe this horror of heart doth vexe mee? oh, noe, let mee bleſſe the Lord and not Speake one word againſt him, but let mee repine againſt my ſin; as the holy prophet David ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.9.</note> 
                  <hi>I held my tongue and Spake nothing, becauſe thou Lord haddeſt done it.</hi> So the Soule ſaith, when the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is even ſeazing upon him, and God ſeemes to caſt him out of his favour, then he ſaith, I confeſſe God is juſt, and therefore I bleſſe his name and yeild to him: but ſinne is the worker of all this miſery that hath befallen mee. The holy Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the great extremity that had befallen the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſaith, <hi>woe is mee for my hurt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 10.19.</note> 
                  <hi>my wound
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18422:56"/>
is grievous, but I ſaid, truly this is my griefe and I muſt beare it.</hi> This is the frame of a heart that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled; it is content to take all to it ſelf and ſo to be quiet, ſaying, this is my wound and I muſt beare it, this is my ſorrow and I will ſuffer it, thus you ſee what the behaviour of the heart is in this contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Hold theſe well for they are of marveilous dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie and great uſe.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> But, what is the dealing of the Lord that the Soule muſt be contented with?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> The behaviour of the Lord towards the Soule in this kind diſcovers it ſelfe in two things. Firſt, In what hee will do to the Soule; Secondly, in the manner of his dealing, how hee will deale with the Soule, and the heart muſt bee contented with both theſe: Sometimes a man will beare a thing, but not the manner of it, that kills him; but God will make a ſinner wayt upon God for mercy, and beg againe and againe and bee content with the harſheſt of his dealings and glad he may have it ſo too.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">The firſt thing that God will have the Soule contented with.</note>1. Firſt thing that God will doe to the Soule, and which the Soule muſt be contented with, is that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and happineſſe, and the acceptation of a mans perſon now, muſt be no more in a mans own hands, nor in his owne abilitie, the Lord hath taken the ſtaffe out of his hand; and ſalvation muſt bee no more put in his owne power. Here is a wonderfull height of pride expreſt before the Soule will yield to this. When <hi>Adam</hi> was created in his innocency, the Lord put a faire ſtocke into his hand, and hee might have traded for himſelfe, and he had libertie of will and power of grace, ſo that he might have gotten the favour of God, by that which he could
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18422:56"/>
doe, if hee would have done hee might have lived: But, when <hi>Adam</hi> had betrayed that truſt which God committed to him in the ſtate of Paradiſe, becauſe hee had forfeited this truſt, the Lord tooke all away from him, and nothing ſhall be in him, or from him any more in the point of Iuſtification, or acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as any way meritorious. <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might have required mercy by vertue of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from God, but <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall now have nothing in his owne power any more, but he ſhall have his Iuſtification and acceptation (not in himſelfe but) in another, even Ieſus Chriſt. So that the reaſon why any Soule is juſtified and accepted with the Lord, it is meerely in an other, not in himſelfe. It is a great matter to bring the heart to this: for the Soule to ſee nothing in himſelfe, but all in and through Chriſt; Oh this is a difficult worke. The Lord will not truſt him with a farthing token. There are two paſſages marveilous uſefull this way, and therein you ſhall ſee the exceeding pride of a mans heart, and it is very common. One paſſage is in the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Where the text ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.31.32.</note> 
                  <hi>The Iew and the Gentiles ſought for righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>how they might finde acceptance and righteouſneſſe in the ſight of God.</hi> The Iew ſought this by the works of the Law, that is, by himſelf, by his ſacrifices, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like; and he thought theſe would have acquitted him in the ſight of God. But the text ſaith, <hi>Iſrael which followed after the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath not attained it,</hi> that is, they have not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, becauſe they ſought it not by faith and from Chriſt, but, in and of themſelves, and therefore they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18422:57"/>
never came to attaine it. But moſt pregnant is that other place,<note place="margin">Rom. 10 2, 3.</note> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I beare them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that they have the zeale of God but not according to knowledge,</hi> for they being ignorant of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, have not ſubmitted themſelves to Gods righteouſneſſe: the cauſe why any man is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of God; it is not becauſe of any thing that he hath or doth, but it is from anothers righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But what a great matter is this: The text faith, <hi>That going about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they have not ſubmitted, &amp;c.</hi> here in this place there is this remarkable. They thought to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, that is, their owne duties, and ſervices, their owne parts and abilities, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought to find acceptance for what they did, they did not ſubmit. Submiſſion argues a point of ſubjection, and the want of this, horrible pride. This is marveilous divelliſh pride, that a man ſhould ſet up the luſts of his owne righteouſneſſe, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thinke to finde acceptance, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with, and pardon from the Lord becauſe of theſe. So that now the Soule is nothing, and the Lord ſaith unto him, thou ſhalt goe in ragges all thy dayes, that Chriſt may be thy righteouſneſſe. Thou ſhalt be a foole, that Chriſt may be thy wiſedome; and thou ſhalt be weake, that Chriſt may be all thy ſtrength, and I will make the ſubmit to that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt. Nay, the Lord ſaith further, if you thinke to finde acceptance, and to purchaſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by what you can doe, then come your way, and bring all thoſe prayers, and duties, and ſee if they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18422:57"/>
can all anſwer my exact Law of righteouſneſſe, and ſatisfie my Iuſtice. Thus the Lord is faine to emptie a man of himſelfe, this is an admirable worke of the Spirit, when the heart is thus content to be at Gods carving, and to have nothing of its owne, to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, weake and meane, and to have all from a Chriſt. This is conſiderable, every man would faine bring ſomething with him, even where God hath wrought grace, and then we are all dead in the neſt, and all amort when we find it not, and we are ready to ſay, if I had theſe, and theſe enlargements, then God would accept mee, but becauſe I have not, the Lord will reject mee. What is this but to ſet up the merits of a mans parts and duties: therefore it is that the Lord will bring the Soule to this, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be juſtified, (not for what he hath,) but for ſomething in another, beſides what hee can doe to entitle himſelfe to heaven and happineſſe. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>To him that worketh not but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth</hi> (on him that juſtifieth the ungodly) <hi>is faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for righteouſneſſe.</hi> This is our nature; We would faine be Ioynt-purchaſers with Chriſt, and have ſomething of our owne of merit (to make us finde acceptance with God) as well as Ieſus Chriſt in the point of Iuſtification. But the Lord will bring the heart to this, it ſhall come as an ungodly wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed traitor, that the Lord may Iuſtifie him in Chriſt. Why dare not a poore ſinner ſometimes come to Chriſt, and looke to him for mercy? Oh, he is not worthy. But, art thou not content to ſee thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe? Yes (ſaith he) but I ſee ſuch pride, ſuch litherneſſe in holy duties, and ſuch corruption
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18422:58"/>
that I dare not goe to Chriſt for mercy. If this be a burthen to thee, and if thou art content to be rid of this, then Chriſt hath prepared mercy for thee, and thou maiſt take it; the Lord will make thee know that thou art not accepted, becauſe thou art worthy, but through Chriſt. The Lord juſtifies the ungodly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond thing that the Soule muſt be content with.</note>The ſecond part of the Lords diſpoſe, that hee brings the Soule unto, it is this. As the Soule muſt looke for what it hath from another: ſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, it muſt be content to take, what mercy, and what that other will give. Not, what the Soule thinkes fitting; but, what mercy accounts the beſt for him. Now, ſee this bleſſed frame of heart in theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The Soule is content that mercy ſhall deny what it will to the Soule, and the Soule is content, and calmed with whatſoever mercy denyes. If the Lord will not heare his prayers, and if the Lord will caſt him away, becauſe hee hath caſt away the Lords kindneſſe, and if the Lord will leave him in that miſerable and damnable condition, which hee hath brought himſelfe into, by the ſtubborneſſe of his heart, the Soule is quiet. Though I confeſſe, it is harſh and tedious, and long it is ere the Soule be thus framed; yet the heart truly abaſed, is content to beare the eſtate of damnation; becauſe hee hath brought this miſery and damnation upon himſelfe. In a word, the Soule ſeeth, that it deſerves nothing at Gods hands; and therefore he is content, if God deny him any thing;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.25.26.</note> and it befals the Soule in this caſe as it did <hi>David:</hi> See how willingly hee takes,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18422:58"/>
whatſoever the Lord ſhall allow him. Where hee ſaith; <hi>Carry backe the Arke of God into the Citie, if I ſhall finde favour in the eyes of the Lord, hee will bring mee againe, and ſhew mee both it and his habitation;</hi> but if he ſhall ſay, I have no delight in <hi>David; Behold here I am, let him doe whatſoever is good in his eyes.</hi> As it was with <hi>David</hi> for a Temporall Kingdome. So it is with the Soule for a Spiritual Mercy. The Soule ſaith, if there be any mercy for a poore rebellious creature, the Lord may looke graciouſly upon mee; but if the Lord ſhall ſay; thou haſt brought dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to thy ſelfe, therefore I will leave thee in it. Behold, here I am, let the Lord doe with mee what hee will.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But, ſome may here object and ſay, Muſt the Soule, can the Soule, or ought it to be thus content, to be left in this damnable condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> For the anſwer hereof. Know, that this contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe implies two things, and it may be taken in a double ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Contentedneſſe ſometimes implies nothing elſe, but a carnall ſecuritie; and a regardleſneſſe of a mans eſtate, he regards not his owne Soule, what he is, nor what he hath, nor what ſhall become of him. This is a moſt curſed ſinne, and this contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is nothing elſe, but a marveilous negligence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods glory or his owne good; and it is a ſinne to give way to it: and it is a fore-runner of damnation to that man which entertaines it. The Soule that is truly humbled and abaſed, cannot (nay it dare not) ſay ſo in cold blood, ſetting aſide paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and temptations). Nay, this contentedneſſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18422:59"/>
argues damnation for ever. This is not meant in this place, neither is it lawfull to give way to it; and it is certaine, upon theſe termes the Soule ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaved; God will make him prize mercy, and care for it too before he have it.</p>
               <p>But then; Secondly, it implyes a calmeneſſe of Soule not murmuring againſt the Lords diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, and this contentedneſſe is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſight of a mans ſinne, and the following of God for mercy. The Soule that is thus contented to bee at Gods diſpoſing, it is ever impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all meanes, and helpes that may bring him nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God, but if mercy ſhal deny it, the Soule is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and reſts well apaid; this every Soule that is truly humbled may have and hath in ſome meaſure. Yet you muſt not throw all at ſixe and ſeavens, no, it is a curſed diſtemper of Spirit that you muſt hate as hell it ſelf. But this contentedneſſe is oppoſed againſt quarrelling with the Almighty, and this every hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Soule doth attaine unto, though it bee not ſoe plainly ſeene. As it is with ſome theife that is taken for a robbery and the ſentence of death hath paſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: he ſhould not neglect the uſing of meanes for to ſave his life and to get a pardon, and yet if he cannot get a pardon, he muſt not murmure againſt the Iudge for condemning of him becauſe he hath done nothing but Law. This theefe ſhould uſe means for a pardon, but if he cannot get one, he ſhould be contented though the ſentence paſſe againſt him: So, wee ſhould not be careleſſe in uſing all meanes for our good but ſtill ſeeke to God for mercy, yet thus we muſt be, and thus we ought to be contented with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18422:59"/>
whatſoever mercy ſhall deny becauſe wee are not worthy of any favour; and the humble Soule reaſons thus with it ſelfe, and ſaith, my owne ſinne and my abhominations have brought mee into this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition wherein I am, and I have neglected that mercy which might have brought mee from it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould I murmure againſt mercy? though it deny me mercy, and if mercy leave me in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate, which I have brought my ſelfe into,<note place="margin">A Sillogiſme.</note> I have but the reward of my owne workes. Marke this well. He that is not willing to acknowledge the freeneſſe of the courſe of mercy, is not worthy, nay, it is not fit to receive any mercy: but that Soule which is not content that mercy deny him what it will, hee doth not give way to the freeneſſe of the Lords grace and mercy, &amp; therfore that Soule is not fit for mercy. I conclude all thus. Iudge with your ſelves whether this bee not a marvellous hideous pride of heart or no? that the ſinner doth murmure becauſe the Lord will not diſpence of mercy as hee will himſelfe, either the ſinner thinkes that he hath deſerved mercy, and therefore he is angry with God becauſe he gives it not, or els, he thinkes himſelfe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to diſpoſe of mercy then God; both which are moſt deviliſh pride of heart, and arguments of a haughty heart that is not yet fit for mercy; nay, if this be in the heart and if the heart allow of this and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this diſtemper, the Soule cannot receive mercy.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> But ſome may object. Can a man feele this frame of heart, to be content, that mercy ſhould have him in hell? doe the Saints of God finde this? and can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18422:60"/>
any man know this in his heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this I anſwer. Many of Gods ſervants have beene driven to this, and have attained to it, and have laid open the ſimplicitie of their Soules, in being content with this. But the ſecret paſſage of the Soule is moſt ſubtle here, and hard it is to finde this, and clearely to diſcerne this frame of ſpirit this way: but the beſt way to gueſſe it, and to be able to diſcern it, is this. For this end, you muſt know theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Soule out of the nature of it, and in nature cannot but deſire the preſervation of it ſelfe, and it is a rule that God hath ſtamped in the creature, and therefore we muſt not thinke that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt or ſhould, or can goe further then nature, and it is not the fault of nature, that it is carried in this kinde.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, the Soule being humbled, cannot but yield it ſelfe, to be diſpoſed of by the Lord as he will, yea, if the Lord will bring deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though the Soule ſometimes finde a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret rebelling againſt God, and a grudging againſt the Lords dealings, and the ſinner begins to ſay, theſe are my corruptions, and ſtill my ſinnes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt mee, and I ſhall one day periſh, and the Lord ſeemes not to looke at mee, and with that, the Soule ſometimes grudgeth, and repines at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, yet the heart that is truly humbled, grudgeth at himſelfe, becauſe he hath ſuch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling heart againſt the Lords dealing with him in this kinde. Nay, I have knowne many in the anguiſh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18422:60"/>
of heart, when they have thus quarrelled with the Almightie, they have falne into a deſperate extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and thought they had committed that ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; Inſomuch, that it hath made them to walke more humbly before God all their dayes; but (I ſay) when the Soule finds theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, it labours to undermine them, and it dares not quarrell againſt God, it dare not but yield, and this is an argument that the Soule is content.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Soule that is contented comes to   be well apaid with this, that mercy ſhall take away from him what it will, friends, and meanes, and eaſe, and liberty, and credit, and whatſoever it is that the heart hath loved moſt. It is content that God ſhould ſtrip him naked of all: And hence it is, that we ſhall obſerve it in experience, and in practice. A broken battered Soule, that hath beene long overwhelmed with the weight of his corruptions, the Lord brings him to a marveilous deſperate low ebbe: You may ſee a man, ſometimes in the torment of Conſcience, that nature and naturall parts begin to decay, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding growes weake, and his memory failes him, and he growes to be marveilouſly diſtracted, and beſides himſelfe, ſo that the partie which was (before) a man of great reach and of able parts, and was admired, and wondred at for his wiſedome, and government; he is now accounted a ſilly ſot, and a mad man, in regard of the horror of heart that hath poſſeſſed him, in ſo much that the husband ſaith, Oh my wife is undone, and the father ſaith, my childe is undone, he was a fine witty childe before, but now hee is a very ſot. Yea, the mercy of God will not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18422:61"/>
leave a man before he be content to be a deſpiſed man, that hee may finde mercy and be ſaved, and mercy will plucke away all thoſe parts and gifts from him, and make him glad to have ſalvation, and all in another: And in concluſion, when God cheeres up his heart againe, hee is more wiſe than ever, and more able than ever, both for temporall, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affaires.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.44.</note> 
                  <hi>How can you beleeve</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>that ſeeke honour one of another.</hi> Without this dealing of God, no man would ever come to heaven, though the Lord ſometimes abates ſome meaſure of it. It may be before this worke, the Soule ſaith, if I may have honours, and eaſe, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and credit, ſo it is; I care not whether ever I have drop of mercy or no: But the text ſaith, <hi>How can you beleeve which ſeeke honour one of another, and not that honour that comes from God onely.</hi> Mercy will bring you downe upon your knees, and you ſhall not be content with the honours of the world; No, no, mercy will make you content to be fooles, and to take that honour onely which is from God, though you be abaſed, and hated, and perſecuted in the world. It is againſt reaſon that the Soule can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, except this be in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">An humble Soule is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall rule him.</note>As the humbled ſoule is content, that mercy ſhall deny him any thing, and take any thing from him, ſo it is content, that mercy enjoyne what it will, and make what Edicts, and Law it will: So that the Commands, and Precepts of the mercy of God in Chriſt may take place in his heart. When <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> came to prepare them for Chriſt, and the hearts of the people were humbled, the <hi>Publicans</hi> came to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18422:61"/>
him ſaying, <hi>Maſter, What ſhall we doe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 3.13, 14</note> and ſo the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſaid, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall we doe?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Doe no man wrong, but bee content with your wages.</hi> The queſtion is not now, covetouſneſſe, and crueltie, what ſhall wee doe? No, the ſouldiers came now, and ſaid, Thou art our Maſter, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of wiſedome is revealed to thee in the Word, command and enjoyne thou what thou wilt, and they are content, with whatſoever hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them. The humbled heart is content, that mercy doe what it will with him, not onely that mercy ſhall ſave him, for ſo farre a reprobate, and a carnall hypocrite may be content. The hypocrite is marveilous willing, that mercy ſhall ſave him; but his luſts and corruptions muſt rule him ſtill. You are content, that mercy ſhould ſave you from your peeviſh heart, and yet your peeviſh heart muſt rule you ſtill; and you are content that Chriſt ſhould ſave you from your drunkenneſſe, and prophaning of the Lords Day, but theſe luſts muſt rule you ſtill. A drunkard that hath gotten ſome dangerous ſurfeit, is content that the Phyſician ſhould cure him, not becauſe he would leave his drunkenneſſe, but becauſe he would have his health, and therefore being up, hee returnes to his drunkenneſſe againe. And the thiefe that is condemned to die, cryes for a pardon, not becauſe he would live to be an honeſt man, but to be free from the halter; and therefore when he is freed, he goes to the hie way and robs againe; it is not for honeſty that he deſires a pardon, but for libertie. Deceive not your ſelves: mercy will never ſave you, except mercy may rule you too.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18422:62"/>
Here is a heart worth gold, and the Lord delights in ſuch a Soule, that falls into the armes of mercie, and is content to take all from mercy, and to be at mercies diſpoſing, and to have mercie ſanctifie him, and correct him, and teach him, and to rule in him in all things. This the heart of a truly abaſed ſinner will have, and it will ſay, Good Lord do what thou wilt with me, rule this Soule, and take poſſeſſion of me, onely doe good to the Soule of a poore ſinner. If the Lord give any thing, he is content, and if the Lord take away any thing, or command any thing, he is content. You that are ruled by your luſts, think of this. When the Lord hath awakened and arreſted your Soules, and you are going downe to hell, Oh, then you will crie, Lord forgive this and that ſinne, it is true, I have hated and loathed the Saints of God, good Lord forgive this ſinne, oh that mercie would ſave mee, then mercy will anſwer, and ſay, When you are out of your beds, you will returne to your old courſes againe, no, he that ruled in you, let him ſave and ſuccour you. I will ſave none (ſaith mercy) except I may rule them too.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The laſt degree of contentedneſſe is this. The Soule is willing that the Lord ſhould make it able to take what mercy will give. This is a lower pegge that the Soule is brought unto. The ſinner before had nothing of his owne in poſſeſſion, nay, he can challenge nothing of the other, but meerely to doe what hee will, and hee is not able to take what mercy will give and beſtow. And therefore hee is not onely content that mercy provide what it thinks good, but alſo to give him ſtrength to take what
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18422:62"/>
mercy gives. The beggar that comes to the dole, though he have no meanes to help himſelfe withall, and though he can challenge nothing of the man, yet hee hath a hand, and can receive the dole that is given him, but a poore ſinner is brought to this low ebbe, (and this ſhewes the emptineſſe of it) that as hee hath no ſpirituall good at all, and can challenge no good, neither is hee able to take that good which mercy provides. The hand of the Soule whereby it muſt receive mercy, is faith, and the humbled Soule ſeeth that he is as able to ſatisfie for his ſinne, as to beleive in a Saviour that muſt ſatisfie. And hee is as able to keepe the Law, as to beleeve in him that hath fulfill'd the Law for him. In Saint <hi>Iohn, beleeving is call'd receiving,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16.</note> and therefore the poore ſinner ſeeth that it is not onely mercy and ſalvation that muſt do him good, but hee ſeeth that if mercy and ſalvation were laid downe upon the naile for beleeving and receiving of it, hee could not doe it of himſelfe, and therefore the Lord muſt give him a hand to receive it with. You know the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.29.</note> 
                  <hi>The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man cannot receive the things that be of God.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle is plaine, <hi>to you it is given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> So that faith is a gift, and a poore ſinner is as able to create a world, as to receive mercy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The want of this, is the cauſe why many a man that hath made a good progreſſe in the way of happineſſe, hee falls ſhort of his hopes. Many a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath beene awakened, and his heart humbled, and the Soule comes to heare of Chriſt, and thinks to lay hold of mercy and Chriſt out of his owne proper power, and thus he deceives himſelfe, and the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18422:63"/>
faith that he dreamed to have was nothing elſe but a fancie, a faith of his owne framing, it was never fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Almighty Spirit of the Lord in heaven, hee never ſaw need of the power of God, to make him able to beleeve as well as to ſave him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his faith and all came to juſt nothing. Now the broken hearted ſinner ſaith, All that I expect it muſt be from another, and I am content to take what mercy will give, and that mercy ſhall deny me what it will, and give me what it will, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that mercy rule in me, nay, that mercy muſt give me a heart to beleeve and to take mercy, or elſe I ſhall never beleeve. Now you ſee what it is that the Soule muſt be contented withall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>Now I come to ſhew the maner of Gods dealing with the Soule, for the Soule muſt be content with this too, as I told you before. The manner of Gods dealing may appeare in three particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Soule ſtoopes to the condition that the Lord will appoint, be it never ſo hard, &amp; it is content to come to Gods termes, be they never ſo harſh and weariſome. As, ſometimes when the ſoule finds that the heavieſt hand of the Lord hath laid long upon him, &amp; that the ſharpeſt arrows of the venome of the diſpleaſure of the Almighty ſtick deepeſt in him, and he finds the fierceneſſe of Gods wrath burning in his heart,<note place="margin">Iob 14.17.</note> and <hi>that all his ſins which have been ſealed up in a bag,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>they are all ſet in order before him,</hi> and the wrath of the Lord (more heavie then any moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) falls upon his back, (I ſay) when the poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner finds himſelfe thus purſued after, in the fierceſt and moſt terrible manner, the abaſed heart dare not flye away from God, nor repine againſt the Lord, but
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18422:63"/>
he lyes downe meekely. 1. He will not flye away from God, for that is his pride. Nay, he dare not doe it. He will not go with <hi>Saul</hi> to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> nor with <hi>Iudas</hi> to a halter. When the Lord let <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſee that hee had betrayed innocent blood, and fill'd his heart with horror, hee did not goe to God and lye down under the harſheſt horror, but he went to a rope and hanged himſelfe, and all through his pride, becauſe hee was not content with the harſh dealing of God, though hee leaped from the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan into the fire, As the proverbe is. And likewiſe <hi>Cain</hi> went into the land of <hi>Nod.</hi> So, when the Lord hath awakened a poore creature, and after a good while, that a man would have thought he had gone on a good way in a Chriſtian courſe, at laſt when he finds that he is not able to beare the wrath of God, but more iniquity comes in againſt him, then hee flyes of from God, and fals from a Chriſtian courſe, and goes to the Ale-houſe, or ſome other baſe courſe, and ſo hardens his conſcience: but (I ſay) the humble Soule dare not doe ſo, but lyes at Gods foot-ſtoole, and if it were the very bottome of the dregs of Gods wrath, and the very fire of hell, he is content to undergoe Gods dealing. He doth not queſtion Gods dealing, and ſay, others are not thus, and thus terrified, and why ſhould I be ſo? No, the Soule returnes all againſt it ſelfe, and ſaith, why doe I talke of others? they have not ſuch untoward, uncleane peeviſh hearts as I have. The humble ſoule reſolves with the Church in <hi>Micah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſinned and therefore I will beare the indignation of the Lord:</hi> So the Soule ſaith, I have ſinned moſt hainouſlly, I
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18422:64"/>
know not their ſinne, but I know my owne ſinne, and therefore I will beare the Lords wrath, though it be never ſo unſupportable, and unſufferable; Lord give mee a heart, that I may be able to beare it. When a Malefactor comes to the Aſſiſes, he lookes for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but condemnation, and execution, if he can ſcape with burning in the hand, or branding in the forehead, or ſhoulder, he is glad, and goes well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, and cryes, God ſave the King, becauſe hee thought he ſhould have beene hanged: So it is with an humble, and a ſelfe-denying ſinner; When the poore creature finds the heavieſt of Gods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him, and ſuch ſtrange diſtempers, as if a thouſand divels were within him, the Soule quiets it ſelfe thus, and ſaith, Why do I thus fret? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I thus perplexed? it is wel that I ſcape thus: I might have beene in hell this day, and bleſſed be God that it is no worſe, that I am not in hell; I might have beene roaring in hell, as thouſands of poore reprobates are, that have no more hope of mercy; therefore I will beare whatſoever the Lord layes upon mee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as he is content with the hardeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo he is content with the longeſt time. Hee is content to ſtay for mercy, be it never ſo long. After the poore ſoul hath his eyes growing dim with wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for mercy, his hands grow feeble, and his tongue cleaves to the roofe of his mouth, and his heart begins to ſinke, and his Soule ſhakes within him, with waiting for the mercy and goodneſſe of the Lord; and yet he finds no mercy, and hath no Inkling of any favour, yet God lookes a farre of.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18422:64"/>
Yet his Soule is content with this. If a beggar ſhould ſtay halfe a day for an almes it would grieve him, though that be his pride. See what <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will waite upon the Lord that hath hid his face from Iacob, and I will looke for him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 8.17.</note> As if the poore ſinner did ſay, The Lord hath hid his face away, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his loving Conntenance from mee, yet I will looke towards heaven, ſo long as I have an eye to ſee, and a hand to lift up, I will yet looke to heaven to the Lord that hath not (as yet) heard nor anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my prayers, the Lord may take his owne time, it is manners for mee to waite and ſtay Gods time: Away therefore with that peeviſhneſſe, and that diſcontentedneſſe of Soule, that when a poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath called, and cryed, and finds no anſwer, and heares no newes from heaven, he ſecretly intends to lay all aſide; As if a man, lift a weight againe, and againe, and ſeeth that it is to heavy for him, he lets it alone. So many poore creatures are content to let all alone, and ſay; why ſhould I waite upon God any more? I have prayed, and cryed thus long, and finde no anſwer; why ſhould I waite any longer? How now? who ſhall have the worſt of it? cannot God have his glory without your prayers? why ſhould you waite? this is horrible pride of heart. Why ſhould you waite? Its no marvell, that you ſhould take ſuch State to your ſelves? who muſt waite then? Muſt the King waite, or the Subject? The Maſter or the Servant? The Iudge or the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Downe with that proud and ſturdy heart of yours. An humble Soule dare not doe ſo; hee is content to waite for Gods mercy, and you will be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18422:65"/>
brought to it too, before ever the Lord will give you any mercy. The humble ſoule ſaith thus, I have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus long, &amp; the Lord ſeemes to be angry with my perſon, and prayers, and all is blaſted, yet I will waite ſtill; Nay, I am glad that I may waite? What, waite upon the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and mercy: Yes, and glad you may. Kings and Princes have done it, and bleſſed are they that waite upon mercy. Nay, the poore broken heart reſolves thus, and ſaith, if I lye and licke the duſt all my dayes, and cry for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy all my life long, if my laſt words might be mercy, mercy, it were well I might get mercy at my laſt gaſpe: Oh, I bleſſe God, that yet I live here, and and that I am not in hell as thouſands are, that waite for judgement and vengeance, bleſſed be God, that yet I may waite, till God looke upon mee in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, when the Soule hath ſtayed a long time, it is content with the leaſt pittance of mercy; he is not like many proud beggars, that thinke much when they have ſtayed long, if they have but a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nay, if hee have but from hand to mouth, It is all that hee craves, and all that hee lookes for. This is our nature; We would faine have ſomething to trade withall, but the Lord will keepe the ſtaffe in his owne hand, and the Soule is content to have it ſo. He comes ſometimes and God will not heare, and he goes away, and comes againe, and then goes away faſting, and well contented too. See how the poore Woman of Canaan did. Shee comes to beg mercy of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.26.</note> and he ſaid, <hi>It is not lawfull to caſt the children bread to dogs,</hi> truth Lord (ſaith
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18422:65"/>
ſhe) I am as bad as thou canſt call mee, I yeild all, I am as vile a ſinfull poore creature as ever any was; <hi>Yet Lord the dogs may eate the crums that fall from their Maſters table.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">verſ. 27.</note> You know the Dog muſt ſtay till his Maſter comes in, and when hee is come, hee muſt ſtay till he ſit downe, and then till he cut his meate, and hee muſt not have the meate from his trencher neither, when he hath ſtayed all this while, he hath nothing but the crums. So it is with a poore ſinner; you muſt not thinke that God will be at your becke: No, you muſt be content with the crums of mercy, and pitty, and lye under the table, till the Lord let the crums fall. The humbled ſoule ſaith, Lord, let my condition be never ſo hard, doe what thou wilt with mee, let the fire of thy wrath conſume mee here, onely recover mee hereafter, and let me finde mercy, and if the time be never ſo long, if at laſt gaſpe I may finde mercy I am content, and whatſoever thou giveſt, I bleſſe thy name for it. The Soule doth not quarrell with the Almighty, and ſay, Why are not my graces increaſed? and why am not I thus, and thus comforted? and refreſhed: Nay, it lyes, and lookes for mercy, and if it have but a crum of mercy, it is comforted, and quieted for ever. Thus the heart is brought very low.</p>
               <p>Why doth the Lord thus bring the heart under,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> is this neceſſary and requiſite? Yes, it is without all queſtion, not onely convenient but very neceſſary, that it ſhould be ſo. And the reaſon is taken from the nature of the covenant of grace which requires this; and without which the covenant of grace could not be fitted for us. For the covenant of grace is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18422:66"/>
this, Beleeve and live. The condition on our part is faith, and beleeving. Now faith is nothing elſe, but a going out of the Soule, to fetch all from another, as having nothing of it ſelfe, and therefore this reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelves, will not ſtand with the nature of this covenant. Now were it ſo, that wee were not reſolved to yeild to, and to be guided by another, it is certaine, we could not have our hearts enlarged to goe to that other: by whoſe wiſedome, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we would not be guided and diſpoſed. To be in our ſelves, and out of our ſelves, to have power in our ſelves, to diſpoſe of any thing belonging to our ſpirituall eſtate, and to fetch all from another; theſe are two contraries, and therefore cannot ſtand together. To have the diſpenſation of life, and grace in our owne hands to diſpoſe of it as we will, it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly overthrowes the nature of this ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mercy and grace in Chriſt. For (I pray you obſerve it) this I take to be the maine difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſecond maine Covenant of grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle diſputes ſo often. And the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, which he ſo often confutes. The firſt Covenant is, to Doe and Live, This <hi>Adam</hi> had, and if he had ſtood ſtill, he ſhould not have needed any Saviour: The ſecond Covenant is, Beleeve and Live, that is, to live by another. Theſe two cannot ſtand together, in one and the ſame Soule, at one and the ſame time. The ſame Soule that is ſaved by the Covenant of Grace, cannot be ſaved alſo by the Covenant of Works. The Lord in the beginning, put the ſtuffe into <hi>Adams</hi> hand, and he had libertie, to diſpoſe of Life and Salvation; by reaſon of that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18422:66"/>
abilitie, and that principle of Grace that God had given him; for he had perfect knowledge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and by the power of theſe he had libertie, freely to pleaſe God, and to keepe the Law, and to be bleſſed in ſo doing, and if he had done that which hee had power to doe, hee might have beene bleſſed for ever, and we all in him, but he loſt it, and ſo overthrew himſelfe, and all his poſteritie: Now we being thus falne in <hi>Adam;</hi> and being deprived of all that holineſſe, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which <hi>Adam</hi> had: Now the ſinner is neither able to fulfill the Law, and ſo to purchaſe mercy for himſelfe; nor to ſatisfie for that which is done amiſſe. A ſinner muſt die, and yet he cannot ſatisfie in dying: he is dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt all that abilitie which <hi>Adam</hi> had: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soule muſt goe out of it ſelfe, and ſince it is ſo, that nothing which he hath, or doth can ſave him, he muſt goe to another, that whatſoever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that other may ſatisfie for it, and whatſoever mercy is needfull, he may purchaſe it, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is to be done, he may doe it. Now, what we have done amiſſe, Chriſt hath ſatisfied for it, and what we cannot doe, Chriſt hath done it, hee hath fulfilled all righteouſneſſe. And hence it is, that theſe two are ſo profeſſedly oppoſite the one to the other, the Law, and Faith. The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Conſider a paſſage or two. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together in the point of Life and Grace; As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If it bee of grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>then it is no more of works, and if it be of works, then it is no more of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18422:67"/>
grace.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>If a man be ſaved by grace, then he cannot be ſaved by works, and if he be ſaved by works, then be cannot be ſaved by grace.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place the ſame Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>If they which are of the Law be heires, faith is made voyd, and the promiſe is of none effect.</hi> If a man that thinks to merit life by the Law be an heire, what needed faith, or the promiſe. For, it is the nature of faith, to goe out to Chriſt, and to receive all from him; now if I had enough in my ſelfe, I had no need of Chriſt, and faith were made of none effect. <hi>You are ſaved by grace through faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle,) <hi>and that not of your ſelves.</hi> There S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings in a deniall, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſinne but of works, and ſaith, <hi>You are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of your ſelves.</hi> He doth not ſay, of your ſinne; but, your ſelves; you, and your works, and all muſt be renounced, and all that you are and doe, as any way meritorious; and not to bee found in your ſelves but in Chriſt, before ever you can receive mercy from Chriſt. So I diſpute thus. There is none that will ſave us, Man nor Angel, and our works will not; therefore we muſt goe to Chriſt, and if we goe to Chriſt for all, and expect all from him, then we muſt be content, to be guided by him in all. Now, let me propound this queſtion: Either thou muſt be content, to be at the diſpoſe of God, and mercy, or at whoſe diſpoſe wilt thou be. If thou wilt have any thing elſe (beſides mercy) to diſpoſe of thee? thou makeſt that to be a Mediator to thee. But haply thou wouldſt diſpoſe of thy ſelfe, and diſpoſe of mercy after thy owne minde? Yes, ſo I thought. It may be thou ſayeſt, I will have grace,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18422:67"/>
if I may diſpoſe of it. Thus a proud heart would faine have it in his owne hands; but upon theſe termes thou never hadſt: (nay, thou never ſhalt have) grace. Here is the winding of the Soule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many dare not venture their ſalvation upon Gods free favour. But they would have it in their owne power, that they may receive it when they will, that they may be drunke and take grace, and be proud, and prophane, and take grace when they will. It is a ſottiſh deluſion of men, that are deluded, and blinded by the divell. But that the Soule (which would have it thus) cannot have it upon theſe termes, I thus reaſon.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>He that will have grace from his owne diſpoſe ſhall never have grace,<note place="margin">Sillogiſme.</note> becauſe he hath none in his owne power to diſpoſe of;</p>
                  <p>But he that is not content to be at the diſpoſe of grace, and to be at the diſpenſation of Gods good pleaſure for mercy and grace, he would have it to be at his owne diſpoſing.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hee ſhall (nay he never can) have grace.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In a word. Who muſt diſpoſe of you? Your ſelves? then you muſt have that grace which you can diſpoſe of, and thats juſt none at all. Grace is meerely in Gods hands to diſpoſe of. Thus wee have brought the Soule to bee fitly prepared for Chriſt, and mercy, and grace.</p>
               <p>Now let us doe as travellers doe,<note place="margin">The ſumme of all this worke of preparation</note> they ſometimes ſit downe, to reckon how many miles they have gone. So let us enquire, what we have ſpoken. You know I mentioned two things, neceſſary in this worke of preparation for Chriſt. Firſt, Contrition.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18422:68"/>
And ſecondly, Humiliation. Firſt, God brings the ſinner to a ſight of himſelfe and his ſin; &amp; makes him to be inſupportably burthened with the vileneſſe of it, ſo that now the heart of a poore ſinner, ſeeth an abſolute neceſſitie of a change, and therefore thinks thus with himſelfe, if I reſt thus, I ſhall never ſee God with comfort. That's for Contrition. Now he ſeeth that hee muſt change, and hee is content to change; and therefore, though he will no more be drunke, nor follow his old baſe practices, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſherke for his owne comfort, and he uſeth all the ordinances of God, to ſee what they can doe for him, and he goes to himſelfe, and his ſelfe-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and finding no ſuccour there, he falles downe before the Lord and begs mercy, and yet he ſeeth himſelfe unworthy of mercy, without which hee muſt periſh. He hath nothing, and hee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to merit it; yet he is content, that God ſhould diſpoſe of him as hee thinks good, onely (if it bee poſſible) he prayes, that the Lord would ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a poore forlorne creature. Now the ſinner is pared, and fitted for Chriſt, as a graft for the ſtocke. He is come to the very quicke, and is as little as may be. All his ſwelling ſufficiency is pared away: For, he is not onely brought to renounce his ſinne, but even his ſufficiency, and all his parts and abilities; which <hi>Adam</hi> needed not have done, if he had ſtood in his innocency. In a word, hee is wholly pluckt from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> (for here is the maine lift) So that now the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt Ieſus, may take poſſeſſion of him, <hi>and be all in all in him,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith): Now, the Soule is a fit matter for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18422:68"/>
Chriſt to worke upon, namely, to make him a veſſell fit to receive mercy and grace: and when hee hath fitted him for mercy, hee will give it to him: and when he hath given him grace, he will maintaine it, and increaſe it, and then quicken it, and crowne it, and perfect it in the Day of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And laſtly, he will glorifie himſelfe in all theſe. Here is a right Chriſtian indeed, that expreſſeth Chriſt in all. Chriſt preparing, Chriſt giving, Chriſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and increaſing, and Chriſt quickening, and Chriſt crowning. Thus you ſee that it is not left as a matter of libertie, but it is of neceſſitie required, that the heart bee thus contented: every humble heart hath this in ſome meaſure, though not (all) ſo ſenſibly.</p>
               <p>The uſes are double. Firſt, to the people,<note place="margin">Vſes.</note> to ſhew them what to doe. Secondly, to the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The uſes for the people are. Firſt, for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, for Examination. Thirdly, for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Fourthly, for Exhortation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Is it ſo that the humble Soule is content to be thus at the Lords diſpoſing? then from hence we collect this uſe, that, they which have greateſt parts and gifts and meanes, and places, abilities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, for the moſt part they are moſt hardly brought home to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. They that are moſt harly humbled, they are moſt hardly converted; how hard a thing is it for ſuch men as have gifts, and learning, and wiſedome, or any bigneſſe that makes them ſwell naturally, how hard is it (I ſay) for ſuch men to be ſaved. I wiſh their courſes did not teſtifie
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18422:69"/>
the ſame; they that are moſt high and greateſt in gifts, and place, they muſt come in at the ſtrait gate, and what a hard and difficult worke that is, judge you, and therefore it is hard for them to come home to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Humiliation is the empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soule from whatſoever it hath that makes it ſwell. The heart muſt not joy in any thing, nor reſt upon any thing, but onely yeild to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to be at his diſpoſing and carving, now theſe parts and gifts, and abilities and meanes (both for Iudgement and place) they are great props and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for the heart of a carnall man to reſt upon and to quiet it ſelfe withall, and to looke for ſome good there from; and when the heart is ſetled upon ſuch pillars as theſe are, it is hard for the word of God to prevaile with that heart. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> knew it well enough and therefore he ſaid, <hi>I will go to the rich and honorable,</hi>

                  <hi>and they burſt all bonds aſunder and brake the yoke.</hi> The poore were naught, but the rich were exceedingly vile; and our Saviour proves it, for when the rich young man came to Chriſt &amp; ſaid, <hi>Maſter what ſhall I do to have everlaſting life:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 19.24.</note> Chriſt anſwered thus, go ſell all that thou haſt, but he would not, and hereupon our Saviour comes to ſhew the difficulty of the worke of ſalvation, ſaying, <hi>it is eaſier for a Camell to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> It is true, a rich man may be brought home, but it is eaſier for a Camel &amp;c. There is great difficulty for a man that hath many gifts and parts to deny all, and to bee at the Lords diſpoſing. If a man were fit to cut a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell ſo ſmall till he were fit to go through a needles
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18422:69"/>
eye, what a worke would it be: ſo it is with a great man. The blind Phariſees ſaw this when they ſaid, <hi>do any of the rulers beleeve in him?</hi> as if they had ſaid,<note place="margin">Iohn 7.48.</note> a company of Coblers, and Tailors, and the baſeſt ſort of people beleeve in him, it is they onely that will not ſweare, and that will ſanctifie the Lords Day; But doe any of the great men, and rulers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. The Apoſtle alſo tooke it for confeſt, and therefore he ſaid, Brethren you ſee your calling, <hi>how not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note>
                  <hi>not many noble men are called.</hi> Indeed, bleſſed be God, there are ſome great, ſome wiſe, and ſome noble men converted. But, not many. For they have ſo much of themſelves, that they are hardly brought to renounce themſelves. Therfore commonly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wickedneſſe, goe both together. And it is a pretty ſpeech of the Prophet <hi>David, There is that great Leviathan,</hi> that great Whale, little rivers have their little fiſhes, but there is that <hi>Leviathan.</hi> So, there is that hideous pride of ſpirit, and that ſtrange reſiſtance of God and his grace; thoſe fearefull cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinnes in great men. Yea, many mightie men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God give them a great deale of grace, they are peſtered with a great deale of corruption; Inſomuch that they are hardly brought home. For a rich man to become poore, and a noble man to be abaſed, and for a wiſe man to be nothing in himſelfe, this will coſt hot water, and yet it will be in all that belong to the Lord. See what the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay. 2.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>The day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and loftie, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low, and upon all the Cedars of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18422:70"/>
Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Okes of Baſhan, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that day.</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Lord ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the mountaines, and make theſe tall Cedars fit to come in at this ſtrait gate. The poore receive the Goſpel, and he that will have the pearle, muſt part with all that he hath; not that God will take away all theſe outward things and parts, but that he muſt looſen his affections from theſe if he will have Chriſt. A poore creature that hath nothing, may more eaſily come to the price of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, then he that hath his hundreths, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands a yeare: What (ſaith one) muſt a man part with all theſe? Yes, the Lord will have the love, that was ſet upon theſe wholy to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Right worſhipfull and beloved, and you of the Miniſtery, ſuffer the words of Exhortation. The greater your parts and abilities are, the greater is your danger; and the greater your places are, the more hard will it be for you to come home to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore as ever you deſire comfort to your ſelves; goe aſide into your cloſets, and thinke thus with your ſelves, The Spirit ſaith, <hi>Not many noble men, not many mightie men, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe men after the fleſh are called.</hi> Hath the Lord advanced mee? then the more care I had need have, and the more I had need to tugge and toyle for Chriſt, for it is marvellous hard to have this proud heart humbled, and for an honorable man to lye and licke the duſt and to take the crummes under the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. You that have theſe honors, and friends and means and parts for the Lords ſake let none of theſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18422:70"/>
beare up your hearts againſt the truth of Chriſt, and let none of all theſe make you ſwell, and ſay, becauſe I am great, or rich, or honourable or wiſe, therefore I muſt not be checked, and ſhall ſuch a man as I bee at the command of a poore Miniſter? alas, we deſire not to have you at our commands, onely we would have you be content to be at the diſpoſe of the Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and that you muſt be; if you belong to him: and glad you may. It is obſervable, that when the Turke comes into the congregation, or the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Idoll, he layes by all his ſtate, and hath no man to attend him for the while: ſo let every man that hath riches, honors, and parts, let them be as if they had none. You that are rich, be as if you had no riches, and you that are honorable as if you had no honors: and you that are wiſe, as if you had no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; when you come to heare the word of God, humble your ſelves, and ſay, my wiſedome, my rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and my depth of judgment ſhall not hinder mee, but whatſoever it is that is my part and my portion, let the Lord ſpeake to me, as if I were the meaneſt and weakeſt in all the congregation. The Lord give you hearts to do it, the worke is hard, and therefore put hard to your hearts to do it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond uſe for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> is an humble Soule content to be at the Lords diſpoſe? then hence I collect that, an humble heart makes all a mans life quiet, and marvellouſly ſweetneth whatſoever eſtate hee is in. That which makes a man content in every condition muſt needs make him quiet whatſoever eſtate he is in; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the heart that is truly humbled may ſometimes be toſſed and troubled, yet he is not diſtracted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18422:71"/>
he is contented, as it is with a ſhip upon the ſea, when the billowes begin to roare and the waves are violent, if the Anchor be faſtened deep, it ſtayes the ſhip; let the tempeſt be what it will: ſo this worke of humiliation is the Anchor of the ſoule; the world is the ſea, and the ſhip is a ſoule that is truly humbled, the deeper this humiliation is, the more quiet is the heart, and the more it is calmed. When <hi>Iob</hi> in the time of his extremity gave way a litle to his proud and ſturdy heart, he quarrelled with the Almighty, his friends and all, but when the Lord had humbled his proud heart,<note place="margin">Iob 40.4.</note> he ſaid, <hi>behold I am vile and baſe, once have I ſpoken, yea twice; but now no more.</hi> And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of <hi>Ionah</hi> that when hee was in peace and in quietneſſe, he had a fullen heart, and when the Lord ſaid, <hi>doſt thou well to be angry?</hi> yea (ſaith he) <hi>I do well to be angry.</hi> See how diſtracted a diſtempered proud heart is, but take <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whalls belly, and wee ſhal heare no more newes of quarrelling, but of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and there he abaſed himſelfe; as it is with a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, when the Patient hath ſome vehement fit of a fever or the like; that he cannot ſleepe, they uſe to give him a litle <hi>Opium</hi> and that makes him reſt a little. This humiliation of heart is like <hi>Opium:</hi> there are peeviſh fits of a proud heart that no word nor commandes will rule a man, but he muſt have what he will, or els he will ſet his mouth againſt heaven, but a little receit of this <hi>Opium</hi> will quiet all, if hee could but come to ſee his owne emptineſſe and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe, and get his heart to be at Gods diſpoſing, then his heart would bee wonderfully calmed and meekened whatſoever he endures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18422:71"/>Humiliation gives quiet to a mans courſe in three cauſes. Firſt in the fierceſt temptations; Secondly,<note place="margin">Three benefits of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> in the heavieſt oppoſitions of men, Thirdly, in the greateſt poverty that can befall a man in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the ſtrongeſt temptations. When Sathan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins   to beſiege the heart of a poore ſinner, and layes battery againſt him; the Soule is ſo ſettled, that he cannot be remooved. See how the humbled heart tires the divell, and runnes him out of breath, and out-ſhoots him in his owne Bow, in the very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all his malice and indignation. Take a poore Soule at the under, when hee hath beene throughly burthened with a corruption, and laid gaſping for a little grace, and favour, and could not finde any evidence of mercy; the Soule cryes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and begs for mercy earneſtly; the divell ſeeth him, and (having ſome permiſſion from God ſo to doe) he lets flye at the poore Soule, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to knocke him off from his courſe, and ſaith to him in this manner.</p>

                  <p>Yet the humble Soule replies in this manner, and ſaith, if the Lord give mee up to my baſe luſts, which I have given my ſelfe ſo much libertie in, and if the Lord will leave me to my ſinnes; becauſe I have left his gracious commands, and if I ſhall fall one day and be diſgraced, and diſhonoured; yet let the Lord be honoured, and let not God looſe the praiſe of his power, and juſtice, and I am contented, if God doe leave mee, what then Sathan?</p>

                  <p>What then ſaith the divell? I had thought this had beene enough to drive thee out of thy wits, yet this is not all.

                  <p>whatſoever God can, or will doe; I know not: yet, ſo great are my ſinnes, that he cannot, or (at leaſt) will not doe ſo much againſt mee, as I have deſerved; if the Lord doe come in Iudgement againſt mee I am contented; ſay what thou wilt, what then Sathan?</p>

               <p>Thus you may runne the divell out of breath; then the divell leaves the humbled Soule.</p>
               <p>The want of this Humiliation of heart, it is where by men are brought to deſperate ſtands; ſo that ſometimes one man goes to a haltar, another runs out of his wits, and another drownes himſelfe: all this is horrible pride of heart. Why will you not beare the wrath of the Lord? It is true indeed, your ſinnes are great, and Gods wrath is heavie, yet God will doe you good by it, and therefore be quiet. In the time of warre, when the great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons flye of, the onely way to avoyd them, is to lye down in a furrow, and ſo the Bullets flye over them, whereas they meete with the mountaines and tall Cedars. So it is with all the temptations of Sathan which beſiege us. Lye low, and be contented to be at Gods diſpoſing, and all the temptations of the divell, ſhall not be able to diſquiet or diſtract thee.<note place="margin">The ſecond benefit.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when Sathan is gone, then comes the troubles, and oppoſitions of the world. And this Humiliation of heart, gives a ſecret ſetling to the Soule, againſt all the railings, and oppoſitions of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18422:73"/>
wicked world: For, this takes of the unrulineſſe of the heart. So that when the Soule will not contend with oppoſitions, but is content to beare them, it is not troubled with them. The humble Soule ſeeth, God diſpenſing with all oppoſitions, and therefore it is not troubled with them. A man is ſometimes Sea-ſicke, not becauſe of the Tempeſt, but becauſe of his full ſtomacke; and therefore, when he hath emptied his ſtomacke, hee is well againe: So it is with this Humiliation of heart. If the heart were emptied truly, though a man were in a Sea of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, if he have no more trouble in his ſtomacke, and in his proud heart, then in the oppoſitions of the world, hee might bee quieted. Conſider <hi>David,</hi> when he was in the wilderneſſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.12, 13.</note> and ſent to <hi>Nabal</hi> for ſome reliefe, ſee how he raged extreamely againſt him, becauſe he was denied it: The reaſon was not in the offence, but in the pride of his heart. Take the ſame man in the perſecution of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.25.</note> ſaying, Art not thou he that kild ſuch and ſuch, and that committed adultery with the wife of <hi>Vriah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> In this his heart was marveilous quiet, and now he was able to beare it, better then the ſouldiers that were with him. Though his cauſe was juſt, and he might have revenged it: yet now he was humble and brought under, and therefore quieted, though never ſo much oppoſed. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of heart, ſo ſettles a man, that though ten thouſand oppoſitions come againſt him, yet nothing will diſquiet him. Caſt diſgrace upon the humble heart cauſeleſly, and he cures it thus, he thinks worſe of himſelfe than any man elſe can doe, and if they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18422:73"/>
would make him vile and loathſome, hee is more vile in his owne eyes then they can make him, and therefore he is contented. If they impriſon an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soule, and perſecute him, hee wonders at Gods goodneſſe, ſo farre hee is from being diſcontented, that he wonders at Gods goodneſſe, and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that he would caſt him into a Dungeon, when he might have caſt him into hell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, this Humiliation of Soule,<note place="margin">The third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</note> brings in ſatisfaction and contentedneſſe, in all the wants that may befall him. Take away from him what you will, and deny him any thing, yet he will be quiet. Hee that is contented with all Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards him, cannot be diſquieted with any thing; The humble Soule juſtifies God, and is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and joyns ſide with Gods providence; he juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God in whatſoever he doth, and therefore is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et in whatſoever he hath done. The ſhip that goes with wind and tide goes eaſily, but if it goes againſt wind and tide, it is wonderfully troubled; ſo, when the humble Soule goes on with Gods bleſſed provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and goes that way which the will of God goes: he goes on quietly, and the want of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of heart is the cauſe of all your diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; when you will ſtand in oppoſition againſt the Almighty; the Lord will have you poore, and you will be rich, the Lord will have you baſe and meane in the world, and you would be honorable, the Lord on the one ſide, and you on the other ſide, you would have it, and the Lord ſaith you ſhall not; if all come not according to your mind, oh then you flye out, God muſt be of your mind, and be at your becke, and

this you muſt have, and that you will have, or els God ſhall heare of you: thus you make your owne trouble, and this troubleſome Spirit breeds all the ſorrow that befalls you; whereas if you would go on with God, you might be quieted and comforted whatſoever condition you were in; as one ſaid, that he could have what he would of God; why, how was that? becauſe, whatſoever Gods will was, that was his will; humiliation quiets all, and ſupplyes all wants, once make the good will of God that which thy heart ſhall yeild unto, and Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the beſt that can befall thee, and then live comfortably for ever. Oh! that our hearts were brought to this. But the pride and vileneſſe of our hearts is ſuch, that we trouble our ſelves needleſly: therefore above all, labour for this. Be content to want what God will deny, and to waite Gods good pleaſure, and to be at his diſpoſing, and then live quietly, and comfortably for ever. Oh! that I could bring your hearts to be in love, with this bleſſed grace of God. Is it ſo, that Humiliation brings quiet in all a mans conditions? Is there not a Soule here that hath beene vexed with the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, did you never know, what it is to be under the malice of an enemy, and did your owne diſtempers never trouble you? Have none of you found hard meaſures at the hands of wicked men? is there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Soule here that is burthened with many wants, and that loves his owne comfort? have you not many neceſſities at home, the want of friends, and meanes, and even of common neceſſaries, and would you arme and fence your ſelves, that no wants may
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18422:74"/>
diſquiet you, nor trouble you, but in all, to be above all, and to rejoyce in all; more then all oppoſitions in the world can doe you hurt, then be humbled, and for ever quieted. Whatſoever can or ſhall befall you, by the divell and his inſtruments, and if every ſpire of graſſe were a divell, be humbled, and then be above all the divels in hell, and all temptations, and oppoſitions, that they ſhall not ſo diſquiet you, as to cauſe you to be unſetled or uncomforted.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you are to be deſired,<note place="margin">The ſecond Vſe.</note> to try your ſelves by the former truth: and let every man try his owne heart, whether ever God hath given him this gracious diſpoſition of Soule or no? You muſt come to this truth: for there is no juſtification nor acceptation without this; Nay, there is no faith can be infuſed into the Soule, before the heart be thus fitted and prepared: no preparation, no perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Never humbled, never exalted; therefore let every man and woman, lay their hearts to the former truth, and conſider this one thing in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. So farre as the heart is from this contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be at Gods diſpoſe, ſo farre it is from true preparation for Chriſt. You muſt be empty, if ever Chriſt fill you: you muſt be nothing, if you would have Chriſt all in all to you. Thus much in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. But, now let us come to the particular tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: and herein let us conſider two things. Firſt, the truth, and ſoundneſſe of our Humiliation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the meaſure of it: both of theſe, this Doctrine doth diſcover to us. It is very profitable to handle them both, that they which have not this work may
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18422:75"/>
be humbled, and that they which have it, may ſee how farre they come ſhort of the meaſure which they ſhould and might have, the want of which is the cauſe of much ſorrow, and the want of much comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How to try the truth of our Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>You may try the truth of this worke of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus. In the generall, looke how you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of in your lives, and converſations. But in particular, that you may ſee where we be, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe three rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us ſee, what it is that ſwayes our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and judgements. Secondly, What it is that over-powers our hearts, our wils, and affections. Thirdly, What it is that rules our lives, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. Try your hearts by theſe rules, and then it will be plaine and cleare, whether you be truly humbled and abaſed or no. You know (I told you) that you muſt not onely be diſpoſed of by God (for God will diſpoſe of you, whether you will or no, he will rule all things in heaven and earth, he will either cruſh thoſe proud hearts of yours by Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation here, or elſe caſt you downe to hell for ever), but you muſt be content to be at Gods diſpoſing. To begin with the former; namely, to ſee what ſwayes our judgements. If you will attend, I hope you ſhall know ſomething in your owne hearts, you that are weake; as for the other, haply they come to quicken up their hearts, and to renew that which they knew before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What ſwayes our Reaſons.</note>Firſt, Let us try whether we ſubmit in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or no? Here is a maine breach; contrary to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18422:75"/>
this ſubmiſſion, is a mans carnall reaſon, and that marvellous height of our conceits, when we raiſe up our owne carnall reaſonings, as ſo many holds, and we maintaine them againſt the truth of Chriſt; and whereſoever this frame of minde is, there this worke of Humiliation was never wrought. And this is in too many. When a man ſwels in his owne conceits againſt the truth of Chriſt. Thats a ſweet place to this end in the <hi>Romans.</hi> Where the text ſaith, <hi>The Wiſedome of the fleſh,</hi> or as it is in the Originall. <hi>The carnall minde is enmitie againſt God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> 
                  <hi>for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> The carnall minde, and all the reaſonings, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of it, is not onely an enemy, but it is enmitie againſt God. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mans wiſedome and reaſon doth not obey, but, he is not able to beare the truth, he (as it were,) ſets himſelfe in battle aray againſt it, it cannot be ſubject to the Law of God. This is a maine wound in all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> That a man (as it were) deifies himſelfe, and his owne dreames, and devices, and makes his owne conceit, a line and levell to all his converſation. So that the carnall minde, will bend the truth to his minde though he breake it. Here is the marvellous pride of a mans minde. Hence it is that the Apoſtle adviſeth us to <hi>be wiſe with ſobrietie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.3.</note> As if he had ſaid, a man may be drunke with his owne conceits; as when a drunkard hath gotten his braines well ſteeped in Wine and Beare; then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he conceits in his minde, muſt needs be as true as Goſpel. So it is with a carnall minde. Though
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18422:76"/>
arguments be never ſo plaine, and Scriptures never ſo pregnant; yet a carnall wretch will carry himſelfe againſt all, and ſay, it is not my Iudgement, I am not of that minde. This is the height of our minde, as if he did ſay, I doe not thinke it, let the word of God, and his Miniſters ſay what they will to the contrary; they ſhall not perſwade mee of it. Doeſt thou finde this in thy ſelfe, then it is an undoubted argument, thou never hadſt a heart truly humbled. See what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If a man thinks that hee knowes any thing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.2.</note> 
                  <hi>he knowes nothing as he ought to doe.</hi> You thinke you are as wiſe as you need to be, and you are not children yet. You that thus lift and ſet up your ſelves in your owne conceits, whatſoever you bee, you know nothing as you ought to do. And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome <hi>that were puft up in their owne conceits,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colloſſ. 2.18.</note> 
                  <hi>intruding into thoſe things which they have not ſeene, vainely puft up in their owne minds.</hi> You conceive and imagine thus and thus, and will not beleeve the Miniſter of God whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaith, therefore you are puft up, and this is not a heart truely humbled and kindly wrought upon.</p>
               <p>A carnall man preſſeth into ſome imagination, as to his owne propper poſſeſſion. As the old proverbe is: The foole will not leave his bable for all the Citie of <hi>London.</hi> So a carnall heart ſaith, I cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perſwaded. I ſay, then the caſe is cleare, is it ſo with thy judgement, and carnall reaſon? then as yet thou wert never under the power of this truth, thou ſhutteſt up doores againſt Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18422:76"/>
he cannot come in to informe thee, thou art ſo full of thy ſelfe.</p>

               <p>Firſt, A carnall reaſon being thus puft up, it is not willing to know the word of God, nor his truth, eſpecially thoſe truthes that are troubleſome and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to him; preach and ſpeake what you will, but preach not that. Hee either wiſheth himſelfe deafe that hee could not heare, or the Miniſter dumbe that hee could not deliver thoſe truthes. The Lord ſent the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> to preach to the people, and yet to ſeale them downe to eternall deſtruction,<note place="margin">Eſay. 6.9, 10.</note> and therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Goe tell this people, heare but underſtand not, ſee, but perceive not, make the heart of this people fat, they winke with their eyes.</hi> As it is with a bleare eye, that is not able to looke againſt the Sunne, but ſhuts for feare the Sunne ſhould hurt it. So, a carnall proud minde is not able to looke into the truthes that may trouble it, and that would awaken his bleare eye. And in another place, the people doe intreate the Prophet <hi>Eſay, to goe out of the way, and to turne aſide out of that path;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 30.11.</note> 
                  <hi>cauſe the holy one of Iſrael to ceaſe from before us.</hi> As if they had ſaid, We cannot endure this holineſſe, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke this exactneſſe, you bid us to be holy or elſe God will deſtroy us, get you out of that path,

they were weary of thoſe bleſſed truthes. A double example we have of this diſtemper of ſpirit in holy Scriptures. As in <hi>Iob, Where the wicked ſay to God, depart from us for wee deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> The drunkard deſires not to heare of any hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of heart for his ſinne: and the hypocrite deſires not to heare that he muſt be ſound, and ſincere, and keepe touch with God in every thing; and ſo all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men goe againſt the truth of God, which croſſeth their luſts and corruptions. And in <hi>Timothy,</hi> it was the tange of a curſed diſtemper of ſpirit in a company of wretches in this age. The text ſaith, <hi>The time ſhall come when they ſhall not endure ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tim. 4.3.</note> And here it is to be noted, that a company of carnall Gentlemen and baſe refuſe people of other degrees are come to this paſſe, that let a plain ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth be diſcovered, they turne away from it, and cannot heare it with patience; but if any man will tell them ſome fine ſtories, Oh, this pleaſeth them admirably: they cannot endure ſound doctrine that ſearcheth the heart, and awakens the conſcience, they cannot brooke that: now, an humble heart is of another minde, it is willing to heare any thing from the Lord, and any meſſage from heaven; and the humble Soule ſaith, Speake on Lord, thy ſervant deſires to heare: the word never ſo troubleſome, and the truth never ſo much croſſing his luſts, hee is well content to heare it. Nay, hee deſires that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and hee is calmed with it. Marke what <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Sam. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Keepe not back from me, but let mee heare whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord hath ſaid unto thee.</hi> An humble Soule
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18422:78"/>
comes to this paſſe, and ſaith, If there be any ſinne or any wickedneſſe in my heart, good Lord diſcover it, and, if there be any duty to be done, Lord let me know it. And as <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 10.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee are all here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before the Lord to heare whatſoever thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us of God.</hi> So the humble Soule ſaith, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever trouble it brings, I yield to the truth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to heare it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the carnall reaſon ſhuts his eye, and will not looke upon the truth, ſo in the ſecond place, if it be ſo that it muſt heare that which it would not, what is the next ſhift that it hath, hee will not ſuffer himſelfe to be convinced by the truth, but when the truth comes in with plaineneſſe, and power, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours what hee can to gather up objections and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills againſt the truth, that he may oppoſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods word, that ſith it is ſo that he muſt heare it, he labours to make it falſe. This is conſiderable.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.8.</note>
                  <hi>Vnto them that are contentious and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe ſhall be indignation and wrath.</hi> Who are they that are contentious; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they that contend with their neighbours, but they that contend againſt the truth, for ſo the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing doe import ſo much, <hi>Which obey not the truth.</hi> One man heares a cloſe point, and then hee goes away, and ſaith, I will not beleeve it, I know reaſon, and I will be bound to confute it, and all this is nothing but a ſmoake: and he deales by the truth, as men doe with an enemie in this caſe. Firſt, they labour to keepe him out from their confines, and if they cannot doe that, then they leavie forces to drive
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18422:79"/>
him out from their land: So it is with a company of carnall men; they would not looke upon the truth to be enformed by it. Well. Heare they muſt, and heare they ſhall, if they live under the power of the Goſpell, but if they muſt heare it, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and adviſe with this carnall friend, and that carnall Miniſter, and if they can get any man to plead for their luſts, that they may arme themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bleſſed truth of God, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy men.</p>
               <p>If a Miniſter come home to the heart of a carnall wretch, that will buy, and ſell upon the Lords Day, and ſay to him, Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath; then hee goes to ſome carnall man that buyes and ſels as well as himſelfe, and then he will have an army of forces againſt the truth of God. As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.8.</note> As <hi>Iannes and Iambres withſtood Moſes, ſo doe theſe men reſiſt the truth, men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, and reprobates concerning the faith;</hi> how is that? When <hi>Moſes</hi> came to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the people of Iſrael, and when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed ſome ſignes and wonders; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not yeild to the Miracles, and therefore he called for <hi>Iannes and Iambres,</hi> and they made ſome appearances of Serpents, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had done, and ſo <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was hardened: even ſo, When the Word of God is plaine, and the evidences of it are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable, then a carnall minde, ſends for carnall quarrels, and pleas, and objections; and this hee doth to oppoſe the truth of Chriſt, and to make an army againſt the bleſſed ordinances of God.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18422:79"/>
They count it a matter of favour, if any man will deliver and reſcue them from the truth.</p>
               <p>As when this truth comes, You muſt not buy and ſell upon the Sabbath, but you muſt be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God is holy, &amp;c. If this truth bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; oh they cannot beare it, and they would faine be reſcued, they account this truth an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to them, and if any man will deliver them from the truth, they thinke him a God; and they admire at his judgement, and ſay, ſuch a man is wiſe, and a deepe Scholler, and hee ſaith thus and thus, hee will defend this as well as I: thus a man is fortified againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>But an humble Soule will not doe thus. After the Word and Truth of God is revealed in this kinde, and all reaſons anſwered: The underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this humble Soule, gives way and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the truth. Give an humble Soule Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that you ſay, and hee hath done; and lets all carnall counſels paſſe: and all matters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and he ſaith, I am fully perſwaded of it, the truth is plaine, God forbid that I ſhould quarrell with it. This is for the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If the truth be ſo cleare and plaine,   that he cannot gaine-ſay it, then he turnes aſide from the authoritie of the truth, and will not ſuffer it to take place in his minde. This is the laſt ſhift which a carnall heart hath.</p>
               <p>As, when a debtor is arreſted, at firſt, hee grapples with the Serjeant, but when hee ſeeth the Bailiffe, or Serjeant, is too good for him,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18422:80"/>
he labours to make an eſcape, and truſts to his feet, rather then to his hands. So, it is with a carnall wretched heart. When hee cannot but confeſſe, and yeild that the truth is plaine, and that hee cannot grapple with the truth, then hee falles flat againſt it: when his Serpent, is eaten up by <hi>Moſes</hi> Serpent; and all carnall pleas are eaten up by the truth, then he is faine to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the authoritie of it.</p>
               <p>From hence comes all thoſe ſhifts: we tell peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they are miſerable, and in a naturall, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable condition: Oh ſay they, God is mercifull: oh but (ſay we) the mercy of God is ſuch, that as he pardons men, ſo hee purgeth them, and if mercy will ſave you, mercy will purge you too, and make you forſake your ſinnes, doe you thinke that mercy will carry you, and your peeviſh proud luſtfull hearts to heaven: No: he will not; then ſay they, we will repent hereafter: and then we tell them againe, harden not your hearts, to day if you will heare his voyce, take mercy now while it is cal'd to day?</p>
               <p>God requires repentance now, and now you muſt humble your ſelves and repent. Yet the Soule goes on, and ſaith, we bleſſe God, we doe repent, and when wee ſweare we cry God mercy, and though wee have beene, and are ſometimes drunke, yet we are ſorry for it, then we make them anſwer, and ſay, you ſay you are ſorrowfull, but ſound ſorrow is ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſound reformation. As the Apoſtle
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18422:80"/>
ſaith, <hi>This ſame thing that you have beene ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, what carefulneſſe hath it wrought in you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11.</note> 
                  <hi>what clearing of your ſelves, what indignation and the like?</hi> And as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and forſaketh his ſinne ſhall finde mercy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 28.13.</note> Then the ſinner replyes, no man can doe thus. What, would you have us without ſinne? we muſt be content to doe, as we may. Thus you ſee, they yeild to the truth, and cannot but confeſſe that it is plaine, but they take away the power of the truth, and the command of it. You may ſee this in that curſed ſhift of a carnall man. When <hi>Balack</hi> ſent for <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaying,<note place="margin">Num. 22.23.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Come curſe this people, and I will advance thee.</hi> The Lord met <hi>Balaam,</hi> and ſaid, thou ſhalt not curſe them, then <hi>Balaam</hi> roſe up early, and ſaid to the Princes of <hi>Moab,</hi> get you home for the Lord refuſeth to let me goe with you: hee laid all the fault upon God, as if he had ſaid, I have a good affection to goe with you, but the Lord will not give me leave. Well, when they came againe, hee ſaid, tarry here all night, that I may know what the Lord will ſay unto me more. He would goe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with God, to doe that which God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly forbidden.</p>
               <p>Thus the carnall heart goes to worke, when hee cannot avoyde the truth, and he would faine have ſome reſervations, and ſuch exceptions, and hee ſaith, is it not poſſible that I may be drunke, and adulterous, and covetous, and yet make a ſhift to go to heaven too, this is a wretched heart; as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>

                  <hi>he that hath this hope</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) purgeth himſelfe as Chriſt is pure.</hi> He doth not ſay, he may and ought to do it, but he doth purge himſelfe, and the Apoſtle Peter ſaith, <hi>be yee holy as Chriſt is holy in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

The Lord be mercifull to us; If your judgements were humbled I can tell what you would do, the heart that is humble takes the truth, and yeilds to the authoritie of it, whereas a carnall heart Lords it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the truth; if it bee thus with thee thy mind was never ſoundly enlightened, and as the Lord lives never humbled, never converted, and neuer brought home to the Lord, ſee what our Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Matth 15.3.</note> 
                  <hi>why do you alſo by your traditions tranſgreſſe the commandement of God.</hi> They ſet their owne carnall traditions cheeke by joll with the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, they made the Command of God without any royalty or power. They were content to give Chriſt the hearing, but they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide from the truth that ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them. If ever thou wouldeſt have the word, worke upon thee to do thee good, then, whereas heretofore thou wouldeſt not come in, nor yeild; now ſhew thy ſelfe to be humbled, and go thy way home, and let this truth take place in thy heart, and be delivered into the forme of this doctrine now in hand, and when profaineneſſe, leud and ungodly ſports come: then remember this, and ſay, I muſt purge my ſelfe as Chriſt is pure, did Chriſt ever thus and thus? did he ever ſit up till twelve a clocke at night ryotting and banquetting? it is a truth, (oh Lord) let it take place in my heart, and let it bee faſtened there.

               <p>Firſt, The heart is weary of the command, and wiſheth ſecretly there were no command of God to croſſe him in his courſe, and to hinder him in his way of ſinne. I will not declare what I have heard wicked wretches ſay in this kinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will not teach men to be wicked. He wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there were no righteous God to bound him. The adulterer wiſheth that there were no ſuch Law as this, he that burnes in his luſts here, ſhall burne in hell. And the drunkard wiſheth that there had never beene any Law made againſt that ſinne, and he ſaith, it is pittie that every man may not drinke what he will: and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt perſon that would be ſtealing and pilfering, he wiſheth there were no Law againſt that ſinne, and when the Word and his Conſcience workes, and the Law makes havocke in his heart, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to throw him to the wall, Oh he is weary of it.</p>
               <p>Now a carnall heart thinks it the greateſt plague
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18422:83"/>
in the world, to be paled in within the compaſſe of Gods commands, that hee may not doe what he liſt, but ſtill, Word, and Conſcience, and the Miniſters checke him.</p>
               <p>When the Lord required, <hi>Sacrifices at the peoples hands in Malachy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malachy 1.13.</note> They thought it a weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſnuffed at it. What every morning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? and every evening too? what a weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this. So, you ought to have morning, and evening prayer in your Families, how are your hearts affected towards it? doe not you ſay, what a weariſomneſſe is this? why doe you tell us of prayer, and of humbling your ſoules? This is a burtheſome thing; this argues a heart that is above the truth, and that would bee free from the truth, and juſtle it to the wall, therefore the wicked are (as it were) in bonds and fetters, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> 
                  <hi>they did not like to have God in knowledge.</hi> As if he had ſaid, it is a vexation to their Soules ſtill to have conſcience calling, be holy and humble, and and be not proud, nor drunke, nor adulterous, their conſciences flies in their faces, and the word galls them, they doe not like to have this in knowledge. And therefore the Lord deales with them after their deſires, and he gives them over to a reprobate mind, and to a heart that ſhall never embrace the truth. You that have no delight to heare of your duties, and wiſh there were no miniſter to controll you, the Lord will ſatisfie your deſires and give you up to a reprobate ſence. As if the Lord did ſay, you are weary of my wiſedome, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18422:83"/>
and weary of my word and commands, I will eaſe you of that burthen, you ſhall have hearts that never ſhall be mooved with my ſpirit; goe all you damned luſts and reigne in him, rule over him and make him a ſlave and bring him downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If the Lord comes and will needs be revealed to   him, then a ſturdy heart layes violent hands upon the command, he diſpoſeth of it, and will not let the command diſpoſe of him; he hinders the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the truth that would draw him to God. As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>they withhold the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe.</hi> The word in the originall is, they impriſon the truth; as if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid, you know you ſhould not bee looſe nor covetous nor drunke; is it ſo conſcience? are you drunke, looſe and covetous ſtill? when the conſcience ſaith, I will be looſe, and covetous ſtill, and you will have the vengeance of God to follow you and go to hell too. They doe impriſon the truth: The covetous man impriſons the truth, and he muſt have his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe ſtill; and the truth is impriſoned at the ſuite of the adulterer, and he muſt be uncleane ſtill. And ſo, the oppreſſor muſt lye, and diſſemble, and oppreſſe ſtill, and therefore he juſtles the truth and will of God to the wall. Hee takes the wall of Gods will. <hi>As the people ſaid, there is noe hope but wee will walke after our owne devices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 18.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and wee will doe every one the Imaginations of his evill heart.</hi> They ſaid moſt deſperately, wee will doe it; heare it and feare all you whoſe conſciences doe convince you

of it, and you know that theeving and ſtealing, and pettiſhneſſe, and peeviſhneſſe, and all your profain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is forbidden; what ſaith your hearts to this? who diſpoſeth of your wills in this caſe? doe not you ſay,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.19.</note> wee will doe what wee liſt? As when <hi>Samuell</hi> had made an evcellent ſermon and told them the danger of having a King, <hi>they ſaid, nay, but wee will have a King over us.</hi> So it is with many of you. Is this humilitie? The Lord ſaith, you ſhall not, and you ſay you will: oh fearefull! is this humilitie? aske but common reaſon; you ſay, wee muſt have and we will have it, wee have had our liberties and wee will have them, and ſo deſtruction too.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, This is the loweſt and leaſt kinde of rebellion, the Soule is content happily to doe what God requires, but it muſt be upon his owne conditions, and his owne termes. This is the laſt, and it argues no ſaving worke of preparation for Chriſt. The hypocrite is content that God ſhall have his glory, but hee muſt doe it. And a man is content to be painefull in his place, provided hee may have eaſe, and honours, and parts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; and be reſpected, but when theſe faile, then God hath broken his condition, and hee will none. Thus God is at his diſpoſe, and ſtands to his agreements. This is a curſed hypocrite. You can be content to heare, and pray that you may have ſome corruption, and that under the name of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion you may be adulterous and looſe ſtill. The God of mercy ſend ſome veine of good motions
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18422:84"/>
into your hearts, to awaken you if it be poſſible. Thus it is with ſome Miniſters that are content to be painefull in their places, ſo long as they may have honour, and be reſpected, but if they miſſe of their end, they give over all. If there be any ſuch here, you are hypocrites, and ſhall never be comforted upon theſe termes.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the third paſſage of this triall,<note place="margin">A mans life muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> namely, what it is that diſpoſeth of our lives. A mans life and converſation muſt be at Gods diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. If the heart be diſtempered, and the reaſon be thus lifted up, then the actions of a mans life muſt needs be anſwerable: If thoſe wheeles goe falſe, then the actions of a mans life muſt ſtrike falſe. As they ſaid, they would walke in their own wayes. And as the Lord ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſa. 66.4.</note> 
                  <hi>I will bring their feares upon them, and my ſoule ſhall loath them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did chooſe their owne devices.</hi> That is, whatſoever their owne corrupt hearts would have, that they will take; and that way they will walke in. Not according to Gods will, but according to their owne rebellious hearts. So that, all the practices of a mans courſe, are nothing elſe but as ſo many diſtempered behaviours of a rebellious carnall minde and heart. This diſordered carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age diſcovers it ſelfe in three particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when a mans life and converſation comes   contrary to God, and goes abreaſt againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: as they did or whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Having their underſtandings darkened,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>have given themſelves over to all laſciviouſneſſe.</hi> They doe not
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18422:85"/>
what God will, but what their pride and idleneſſe will.<note place="margin">Prov. 28.18.</note> The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He that is perverſe in his wayes ſhall fall at once.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When you were the ſervants of ſinne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>you were free from righteouſneſſe.</hi> What's that? Holineſſe and Gods command had nothing to doe with them, that never tooke place in their hearts. Doe you thinke theſe mens hearts are at Gods diſpoſing? See what the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Faſhion not your ſelves like unto this world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> I onely appeale to mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, what ſtrange apparell, and haire laid out, and what Spaniſh locks be there now adayes? who diſpoſeth of theſe things? Oh forſooth, they are newly come up, and they muſt come up to thy head, and armes and all. Theſe ſtrange faſhions doe argue ſtrange diſtempers of ſpirit, and doe you thinke that God rules in thoſe hearts? and minds, and God over-power thoſe affections? when as they will not give him leave to meddle with a haire, or a locke, or an excrement: this is my judgement in this caſe. If it be ſo, that the Word of God may not take away a lap, and an excrement, our ſhame, and thoſe things that are ſcandalous, then ſurely the Word of God muſt not plucke away our luſts. No, no, you are as farre from ſubjection, as heaven is from hell, and as the divell is from the God of Hoſts. The Lord ſpeakes plainly by the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee will viſit all thoſe that are cloathed with ſtrange appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</hi> When the fire ſhall flame about your eares, and the enemies come to plucke your feathers
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18422:85"/>
from your Caps, then you will remember this. You would not have God to diſpoſe of your cloathes, and haire, and the like, and therefore God will now diſpoſe of your lives and liberties, and when you lye upon your ſtraw, and ſee that you muſt not goe gay to heaven, you would then be content that the Lord ſhould diſpoſe of you, and looke graciouſly towards you; and then you will recommend your ſouls to God. But then the Lord will make you anſwer and ſay, who had the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of you before, a drunken, adulterous, and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Soule, therefore let them ſuccour you now, get you to your faſhions, and let them make you fry and roare in the faſhion, he that will not have theſe baſe trifles to be at Gods command, ſurely he will never have his heart at Gods diſpoſing, and therefore neither minde, nor heart, nor life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If God will over-rule wicked men   a little, and pull downe their trim faſhions, and will gripe the Vſurer, and ſend the thiefe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Cheſts, and if the Lord ſay, you ſhall not be rich, nor honourable, as you would: though you ſeeke them never ſo faſt.</p>
               <p>Yet ſecondly, they uſe all carnall ſhifts, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deviſes to come from that woefull condition into which God hath caſt them. A man cannot endure to be poore, and therefore he will ſteale, cooſen, or oppreſſe, and take any courſe to lift up himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Sometimes a man is content to be at   Gods diſpoſing in an outward conformitie, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18422:86"/>
he will doe the duties that God reveales, and leave the ſinne that God forbids, and gives a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: but why will he doe this? He doth not theſe to honour God, but for ſome by and baſe ends. As when the hypocrite prayeth, God doth not make him pray as the firſt mooving cauſe of the worke, but his hypocriſie: and ſo the diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling profeſſor, that will profeſſe for advantage, to draw people to his houſe, or to ſell off his Wares more readily. And that people may ſay, Oh he is a marvellous honeſt man; yes, and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous wretch too, and he makes Religion as a ſtalking Horſe, for his luſts. You are not at Gods diſpoſing, unleſſe you be at his command in all theſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the pride of a mans reaſon, in his will, his heart and life, wherein you ſee the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate villany of a mans nature, and all is oppoſite againſt the God of heaven. If every bird had her feathers, and the worme her ſilke, and every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their owne, what would become of the man that is proud. This is baſe enough, yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that Maſſe of haughtineſſe, and <hi>Luciferian</hi> wretchedneſſe that is in the heart. That a poore creature ſhould ſet his will againſt Gods will, and his way againſt the way of the Almightie; before whom the Angels ſtand amazed, and the divels doe tremble. God ſaith, I will have this, and the Soule ſaith, I will not have it: God ſaith, thou ſhalt not walke in this way, but the Soule ſaith, I will walke in it; God ſaith, thy reaſon, thy will,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18422:86"/>
thy life, and all ſhall be ſubject to race, but the Soule ſaith, they ſhall not. Is not this infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable haughtineſſe? What, to make God no God, and that he muſt have no will, no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and no rule over a mans life. Oh you that are guiltie in this caſe take notice of it. And, let me exhort you all that have heard the Word of God this day, and are poore ignorant men, and prophane, and carnall hypocrites. Ignorance rules one man, and his corrupt luſts rules an other man, but there is no good rule at all.</p>
               <p>You have the Word of God and his counſels, and you have ſeene the way ſet out, now what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, but that you be intreated to goe home and humble your ſelves in ſecret, and ſay, this is my proud reaſon, my proud heart, and this is my proud carriage, it is I that would not ſubmit to the command of Gods Word. And let every ſervant come in, and ſay, this is my proud heart, my Maſter, and my Miſtris may not ſpeake, but I give word for word: this is my fault. And you wives reaſon thus: Now the Lord hath revealed the pride of my heart, and this is my proud rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and will, that would not yeild to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my husband though never ſo warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Let the child alſo humble himſelfe, and ſay, when my father counſels mee, I turne my deafe eare; and my mother is but a woman, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would have my owne will, and walke in my owne way, this is my vaine minde. How many be there preſent here this day, that are not willing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18422:87"/>
to know ſome truths. You know you have made many conſpiracies againſt the Word of God in the middle of the night, becauſe your honours, eaſe, and liberties lay at the ſtake, therefore the Word muſt not rule, If it be thus, then to this day you are carnally minded, and ſtout-hearted and vaine. Goe home therefore I charge you, and as you tender your owne good, goe into your private chambers, or elſe into ſome fields, and there get downe your knee, though your hearts will not bow, and ſay, good Lord, I know and confeſſe it to this day my carnall minde hath not beene brought under, and this vaine and idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation hath not beene ordered by thy word: I have known much, and gone on in rebellion againſt thee, and it is a wearineſſe to mee to ſanctifie the Sabaoth, and hearing, praying, and other holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are a burthen to mee: to this day my heart is not prepared for mercy, good Lord, to this day I am a wretched carnall man.</p>
               <p>This is ſomething, Now there is ſome hope. And the Soule goes on further, and ſaith, Good Lord, what will become of my Soule, am I Gods to diſpoſe of; no, no, pride and peeviſhneſſe hath rul'd mee, and I muſt cloath my ſelfe as Pride would have mee. This is ſomewhat indeed. And the adulterer ſaith, If the adultereſſe come, I muſt goe though I dye for it. When the drunkard comes to pull you out, tell him of this, and ſay, Who hath diſpoſed of you this day, and all your life, a drunken wretch, and a baſe queane. You have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18422:87"/>
heard the word of God checking of you, and yet nothing would doe, Oh now at laſt yield, and ſay, The Lord hath not diſpoſed of me. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour that God may diſpoſe of you, and let the mighty God pull downe that mightie heart: Challenge the Lord with his promiſe, and give him no reſt till hee have mercy upon you. And you ſervants, humble your ſelves, and ſay, Wee have beene proud and idle together, now let us mourne and pray together. The time ſhall come when you will be content that God ſhould diſpoſe of you, and you ſhall deſire the Lord to looke gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly towards you, and that God would take away your corruptions, and that pride which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth you, and all thoſe abhominations that have beene a ſhame and diſgrace to you, therefore now reſolve with your ſelves, and ſay, Lord, take away this ſinne, and ſubdue that corruption, and doe thou rule and reigne over my heart and life for ever: let the power of thy truth carry mee, and turne me from my wickedneſſe, and over-power this proud will of mine, and whatſoever vanity is in my life, good Lord take it away, and frame me after thy minde. When this time comes, ſay, That a poore Miniſter did wiſh you good, and that you had a faire offer. If you will be at Gods diſpoſing, in minde, in heart, and life, the Lord will prepare a place for you in heaven, and rancke you there amongſt his bleſſed Saints and Angels for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>If another mans ſervant come to demand of you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18422:88"/>
meat, drinke, and wages, you will ſay, You have not beene at my command, therefore goe to the Maſter that you have ſerved, let him pay your wages: So it will be with you, if you goe to God for mercy, and comfort in that day, the Lord will ſend you to your luſts and new faſhions, &amp;c. but if any man be Gods ſervant, then every thing ſhall be fitted for him, and though that day be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the proud and haughty ſpirit, yet it will be a comfort to the godly, that they have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to Gods word. For, then Chriſt ſhall fill their mindes with wiſedome, and their wills with holineſſe, and their lives ſhall be made honourable and acceptable before him. Think of this, and labour to bring your hearts to it, that Gods will may be your wills, and if you be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, you ſhall and muſt be for ever comforted. Thus much of the triall of the truth of our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond part of the uſe.</note>Now I come to the ſecond part of the uſe, that is, to examine the meaſure of our humiliation: for (as I conceive) all the difficulty of a mans courſe lyes here, and the cauſe why a man receives not the aſſurance of mercy from God that hee deſires, or that comfort that he might, it is all from hence (I ſay) becauſe he is not empty. For if the heart be prepared, Chriſt comes immediatly into his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the leſſe wee have of our ſelves, the more we ſhall have of Chriſt. This is mervailous uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therefore you muſt know that though the heart be truly humbled, and laid low in it ſelfe in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18422:88"/>
truth, and the thing is done, yet there remaines a great deale of pride in the heart. Take a mighty Caſtle, though it be battered downe, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines many heapes of rubbiſh, and happily ſome of the pillars ſtand many Winters after: So it is with this frame of Spirit, in a high imagination,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> in theſe Towers of loftineſſe. Though this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> of a mans ſelfe be fallen downe, yet ſtill the ſtumps remaine, and will doe many yeares. And it will coſt much horror of heart, and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before this haughtineſſe of heart will be every way pull'd downe, and made agreeable to the good will of God. Though this diſtemper is mervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſecret, yet a man may take a meaſure and ſcantling of it,<note place="margin">How to try the meaſure of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Triall.</note> and hee may know how much of this curſed rubbiſh remaines in his heart, by theſe foure particular rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, looke what meaſure there is of carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning againſt the truth of God when it is made knowne, what meaſure there is of it either ſubtilly comming in upon the heart, or elſe that doth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tranſport the ſpirit againſt the ſpirit, ſo much need thou haſt of Humiliation, and ſo much thou wanteſt of it. This is a cleare caſe. Every Saint of God is willing to know the truths that he ſhall doubt of, and is content to yeild himſelfe to the truth that ſhall be revealed, and of which he ſhall be convinced, yet there remaines much carnall reaſoning againſt the truth. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Let no man deceive you; intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.18.</note> 
                  <hi>vainely puft up
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18422:89"/>
in his fleſhly minde.</hi> The ground and roote of this carnall reaſoning, or the meaſure of it may appeare in two cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a kinde of perverſe darkneſſe in the heart, ſtill ſticking in the minde and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, even of a gracious Godly man. And from hence, namely, out of this miſtaking of the minde, followes all that carnall reaſoning: that, howſoever the Soule is ſatisfied, yet it will not ſit downe, but ſtill it ſticks in this carnall reaſoning, and the ſinner cannot conceive the truth, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the compaſſe of it, by reaſon of his owne weakeneſſe, therefore it is long before hee will be perſwaded that it is truth, and that he is bound to yeild to it. When the wiſedome of the truth is ſo plaine and evident, that he cannot reſiſt the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, yet becauſe he cannot conceive of it, he thinkes, that hee is not bound to yeild there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But ſome will ſay, ſhould a man yeild to that which he cannot conceive?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this I anſwer. When the minde is ſo farre enlightened, that he cannot gain-ſay any thing in reaſon, though he cannot compaſſe the depth and bottome of the truth, yet he ſhould yeild to it, and rather goe with reaſon, then follow his owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, when there is no reaſon for it. Iuſt ſo it was with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> When Chriſt ſpake of the worke of regeneration,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.9.</note> he ſaid, <hi>Can a man be borne againe the ſecond time.</hi> Well, Chriſt opens the myſtery of regeneration, and the ſecrecy of it the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18422:89"/>
ſecond time, and when <hi>Nichodemus</hi> could not comprehend what Chriſt had ſpoken, yet hee would hold his owne, and ſaid, how can this be, I cannot conceive it; becauſe he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it; therefore he throwes all away. Marke how Chriſt hits him in the right veine, and ſtrikes him to the bottome, and ſee how hee tames him: <hi>Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael and a Doctor in Law, and yet art ſuch a novice in this worke of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> downe with that proud heart of thine. Lay downe all thy carnall reaſoning, and become a foole, and ſo thou may underſtand this truth that is communicated to thee.</p>
               <p>This is ordinary amongſt us, for a man to ſay, I cannot beleeve it, I ſee it not, and I thinke not ſo; and yet they have no reaſon at all to carry them, but becauſe they cannot comprehend it by that light which they have, therefore they will not yeild to any reaſon, becauſe they cannot ſee it by their owne light, they will not uſe Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles (as I may ſo ſay) looke how much of this carnall reaſoning thou haſt, ſo much pride thou haſte, and this is very much, ſpecially in the moſt ignoranteſt Soules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe of the weakeneſſe, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of their judgements, which are not able to hold a truth when they have it in their hands, but it goes away like lightening, and becauſe the minds of theſe poore creatures, are over-worne with many thoughts, and curſed reaſonings, and troubled therewith, they grow unable to helpe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18422:90"/>
themſelves againſt thoſe diſtempers. And hence it is, that though the Word of God be let in, and made cleare, yet a man ſtoopes to thoſe conceits, and curſed reaſonings that have beene attended to, ſo that they take of the power of the truth. As it is with a Ferriman: hee applyes the Oare, and lookes home-ward to the Shore where he would be, yet there comes a guſt of winde that carryes him backe againe whether he will or no: So many a poore humbled creature, that is truly wrought upon, and hath a true title to Chriſt; he applyes his Oare, and would have aſſurance of mercy from Chriſt, yet the over-whelming of carnall reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and curſed ſuggeſtions (that are either caſt in or ſtirred up in his heart) throwes him backe againe, and take of the power of the truth; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he can ſee nothing, nor yeild to any thing for the good and comfort of his Soule. I take this to be the ground of all the trouble that befals a broken heart. Let any man under heaven give mee the reaſon of this; why any Soule that is truely burthened for ſinnes as ſinne, and hath found God marvellous gracious to him this way, why (I ſay) after all his cavils are remooved, and all his objections are fully anſwered, and all controverſies are ended, and this often done; yet a poore broken hearted creature, will ſtill recoyle to his former carnall reaſonings againe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe all the anſwers that were given are now forgotten, and all his cavils, and carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits will be freſh in his minde as ever they were,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18422:90"/>
partly from the haunt they have had in his minde, and partly from that ſelfe-willy waywardneſſe of the heart, that is content to goe that way.</p>
               <p>They that have beene long over-whelmed with theſe curſed carnall cavellings, they will rather la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to oppoſe a direction, then to hold it and to walke in the comfort of it, onely becauſe of the weakeneſſe of their underſtandings, and their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſonings are ſo violent againſt them. Vpon this hindge it is that (as I take it) all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a company of poore broken hearted doe hang, and by this meanes they keepe out that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which they might have, and in the ſtrength whereof they might walke all their dayes. I might propound many inſtances, as thus; come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Soule, and ſay to him, why walkeſt thou ſo uncomfortably ſeeing thou haſt now a title to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſalvation in Chriſt? ſee what he replies, I a title to mercy? nay, I am utterly unworthy of that title, it is a great gift and few have it, and I have beene a vile wretch and an enemy to God and his glory, what I a title to mercy? we reply againe. God gives grace to the unworthy, he juſtifies the ungodly, and not the godly, and if he will give you mercy too, what then? hee replyes againe, What mercy to me? Nay, it is prepared, for thoſe that are fitted for it, had I ſuch a meaſure of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and ſo much grace, if I were ſo and ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if my heart were thus diſpoſed, then I might have ſome hope to receive it: wee reply againe. But have not you beene weary of your
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18422:91"/>
corruptions, and are you not content that God ſhould doe that for you, which you cannot doe for your ſelves; this is the qualification which God accepts, and requires, and by which hee fits the Soule for mercy; unleſſe you have that other of your own conceits you will have none, and ſo you deprive your ſelves of mercy; you have a childs part, and a good portion too, if your proud hearts would ſuffer you to ſee it. Then the Soule ſaith; I would have the Lord ſay to my Soule, be of good comfort, I am thy Salvation; if the Lord would witneſſe this to mee by his Spirit, then I could beleeve it: content then, only let us agree upon the manner how it muſt be done, and how God ſhall ſpeake it. Will you then yeild it? Yes, then know this, what the Word ſaith, the Spirit ſaith, for the hand and the ſword, the Word and the Spirit goe both together. For as the text ſaith, <hi>My Word and my Spirit are one.</hi> Then take the Word and lay thy heart levell to it, and ſee it. The Word ſaith, <hi>Every one that is wearie ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed;</hi> Haſt not thou beene weary, and haſt not thou ſeene ſin worſe then hell it ſelfe? The Text, the Word, the Lord, and his Spirit ſaith, Thou ſhouldſt come: and the Spirit ſaith, thou ſhalt be refreſhed. Oh ſaith the ſinner, I cannot finde this aſſurance, and this witneſſe of Gods Spirit, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it, and I cannot beleeve it: Thus he leaves the judgement of the Word and Spirit, and cleaves to the judgement of his finding, and feeling: and thus he judgeth Gods favour in regard of his own
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18422:91"/>
imaginations, and not according to the witneſſe of the Word and Spirit: the Spirit ſaith, Thou art fitted for mercy, but becauſe thy ignorant blinde minde conceives it not, hence it is that thou ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the doore againſt the mercy of God revealed, and that would be ſetled upon thy Soule for thy everlaſting comfort. Thinke of this, and ſay, Whether is it fit that my wit ſhould determine my eſtate, or the word of God? Will you determine the cauſe, and perke into the place of judgement, and ſay, I feele it not, and I feare it? Is not all this carnall reaſon? Here they runne amaine, even a-breaſt againſt their owne comfort, and will not receive the Word that might convey what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is needfull for them. I charge every poore Soule to make conſcience of reſiſting the word of God, as you deſire to make conſcience of lying and ſtealing: This is a ſinne though not ſo great as the other. Make conſcience of this carnall cavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, pull downe thoſe proud hearts, lay downe all thoſe carnall reaſonings, and let the word of God rule you, &amp; then comfort will come amaine. I take this for a truth; That, when the heart is truly humbled and prepared for mercie, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed and conuicted of the way to ſalvation, the cauſe why the heart cannot receive comfort, it is meere pride of a mans ſpirit one way or other, it is not becauſe he will not, nor becauſe God will not, but becauſe hee liſtens to what his carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaith, and not to the plaine will and word of God. I ſay, make conſcience of it, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18422:92"/>
will come amaine into your Soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond triall of the degree of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note>The ſecond triall of the meaſure of our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, is this. Looke to thy diſcouragements. For as the diſcouragements of thy courſe are, ſo is the pride of thy heart.</p>
               <p>If the ſtream run amain here, there is much pride, if little diſcouragement, then there is little pride. This is nothing elſe, but when the Soule out of the feare of evill that it either feeles or expects, and the price that it puts upon it ſelfe, and that it lookes for from it ſelfe, it is nothing elſe but the ſinking of the ſoule below it ſelfe. As the Author to the Hebrewes ſaith, Conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.3.</note> leaſt you grow weary, and faint in your owne mindes. The word in the Originall is, as if their ſinewes were ſhrunke. This is an undoubted argument and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſo much pride as this doth appeare. When a man is driven to a deſperate ſtand, and comes to lay a diſpondencie, and to lay himſelfe too low, and is not able to beare the blow that God layes upon him: for, were the Soule as willing to take the want of good if God denie it, as to take good when God gives it, it would not be ſo diſcouraged. The heart is content to have good, but if God take away this good, hee is not content to be at Gods diſpoſing therein, but if this good goe away, hee ſinks and is diſcouraged, and this argues pride. The heart deſires to have riches, and eſpecially honours in the world, happily God denies this, &amp; throwes filth and diſgrace upon his perſon, and now the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18422:92"/>
Soule is deſperatly downe and forlorne in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: So much as thou haſt of this, ſo much pride thou haſt. Why art thou not content that God take away any thing? the truth is, thou wouldeſt be at thine owne diſpoſing, and that which thou wouldſt have thou art not able to want. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a thing that wee muſt take ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, know therefore that this diſcouragement appeares in theſe ſeverall paſſages, and pride vents it ſelfe in them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, This keepes a man from comming to the   worke, when he is called to it.<note place="margin">Signes of a diſcouraged heart.</note> Though the Word of God is never ſo plaine, and his calling to it never ſo cleare, yet he is loath to come in at Gods call, and when he is come hee is quickly weary, and ſaith, what doe I heare? Aske God that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinks, he ſhall not finde the ſucceſſe that he deſires, therefore he is loath to come to it, this is horrible pride. Thus it was with <hi>Ionah:</hi> he was ſent to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and becauſe hee thought God would ſhew mercy to them, and he ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a falſe Prophet; therefore he would not goe, but turnes to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> hee was not able to beare the croſſing of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It damps the Soule, and (as I may ſo ſay) it knocks of the wheeles of a mans endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, when hee ſets upon the worke, and it kils him at the roote. As the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why art thou caſt downe within mee oh my ſoule?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 43.5.</note> 
                  <hi>why art thou ſo diſquieted within me?</hi> As a man that awakens from a ſwound, he wonders at himſelfe:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18422:93"/>
ſo did this Holy man. Thus it comes to paſſe, that the Soule recoyles upon it ſelfe, and the heart gives in, and he (as it were) trips up his owne heeles, that, howſoever a man is able to doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet by reaſon of diſcouragements, he is not able to put forth that which he can doe, for feare he ſhould not doe that which he would.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this diſcouragement marvellouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers a man after the worke. When the worke is done by others, if they finde acceptance, and have good ſucceſſe, this comes like cold water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soule, and then hee goes away and ſaith, Oh hee is fit for nothing, and hee is unable to doe any thing, as if a man ſhould ſay, Hee hath no light becauſe another mans candle burnes clearer then his: but after his owne worke, all his care is what will become of the buſineſſe, and how his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and how his Sermon tooke, what approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his gifts, and what admiration of his parts, and if the acceptation of others anſwer not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, then his Soule ſinks downe, and hee is even weary of himſelfe, his worke and all. If no man commend him, and the worke is not approved, then hee complaines of himſelfe this way and that way, and begins to diſparage himſelfe, onely to fiſh out commendation from others, and to ſee what they will ſay, if they commend him, then hee goes away rejoycing, if not, then he ſinks, ſpecially if hee have not grace to goe in ſecret by prayer, to quicken up himſelfe with ſome promiſe after that drunken fit. So the truth is plaine, it is wonderfull
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18422:93"/>
to ſee what pride there is. One man is ſicke of the ſullen, becauſe the breath of men departs, and hee falls ſhort of that which he expected. Though I ſhould prepare my ſelfe never ſo well, yet if the Lord did ſtop my mouth now in the pulpit, let me be humbled, but comforted and contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>The third Triall of the meaſure of our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is this diſcontentedneſſe in a mans occaſions,<note place="margin">The third tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Humiliation.</note> and ſo much of this as there is, ſo much pride thou haſt in thy heart, where this diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe growes, there is this bitter roote of pride alſo. The nature of a proud heart is not able to beare any ſuperiour, and if it be checked, it falles to ſtrange murmuring, and gaine-ſaying. This diſcontentedneſſe lets out it ſelfe in five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and there is a world of pride in them all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Soule will grudge at the diſpenſation of God, and ſnarle at the providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, as if God had forgotten himſelfe. He quarrels exceedingly with the Almightie, if God anſwer not his will, and his hearts deſire. When the Lord had prevailed with the peoples hearts, and they had humbled themſelves, and the Lord had turned from his wrath; ſee how this man fals out with God! Oh, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Ionah 4.1, 2.</note> I thought ſo much when I was in my owne countrey, that thou wouldeſt ſave this people, and I ſhould be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a falſe Prophet, and thus my glory lyes in the duſt. You thinke God is beholden to you for your prayers, and faſtings, and you ſay, how is it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18422:94"/>
that after all our prayers yet we have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſuch a man is cheared, and ſuch a poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is refreſhed, and yet they have not the parts that we have, and they have not prayed as we have done, thou haſt ſhewed mercy to them, and therefore why not to us too. This is horrible pride.</p>
               <p>See how a proud ſoule juſtles God out of the place of of his providence, and brings the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his barre, and to his judgement; and the heart begins to reaſon inwardly, and ſometimes vents it outwardly, and ſaith, had the Lord given mee that grace and fitted a place for mee, I could have done much for God, and ſome good to his Church, and I could have miniſtred much comfort to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: this is the Engliſh of it. As if hee had ſaid, had the Lord beene ſo wiſe (to deviſe a meanes to effect this glory) as I am, then great matters might have bene done. This is to make a mans wiſedome above God, and his mercy, grace wiſedome and all. Oh! this is devilliſh pride.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſlights all mercyes received, and all that God beſtowes from day to day; becauſe he cannot have what he would, therefore he cares not for it, and he regards not what hee hath. As <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Heſter 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>all this honor and theſe riches availe mee nothing, ſo long as I ſee the Iew Mordecai ſitting in the gate.</hi> This one thing denyed him, made him no to regard whatſoever hee had; and it was not onely ſo with <hi>Haman,</hi> but even with good <hi>Ionah.</hi> When God had prepared a goard, becauſe he tooke
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18422:94"/>
it away againe ſuddainely, <hi>Ionah</hi> tooke on excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and forgetting all Gods mercyes in the depth he quarrels with heaven,<note place="margin">Ionah 4.9.</note> and when the Lord ſaid, <hi>doſt thou well to bee angry; yes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even to the death,</hi> thus he commends himſelf. The reaſon is, the Soule is like a ſullen child, who becauſe his coate is not garded as he would have it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is diſcontented and will havs none at all. Therefore the Soule ſaith as they did of the two litle fiſhes,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.9.</note> heere are five barly loaves and two fiſhes but what are theſe amongſt ſo many people. So the Soule ſaith, oh! he hath nothing and he can doe nothing, and God frownes upon him &amp;c. but, hath not God given you a care and conſcience to reforme your lives? and hath not he done this and that for you? oh yes, but whats this to that I might have had and that I would have? oh, downe with that proud heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The diſcontented Soule will quarrell   with his owne condition whatſoever it is, though he had a condition of waxe as the Proverb is, hee is never pleaſed nor quietted, but hee hath ſtrange Imaginations in his mind, and ſtrange liftings up of his owne conceiptes, and he ſaith, If God had ſet mee in ſuch a place anſwerable to my gifts and parts, then ſuch a thing might have beene done: but God hath put him (as it were) under a clod, and therefore hee hath no care of himſelfe as God hath had no care of him: nay, let him have that condition which he deſires, and he falls out with that too;<note place="margin">Gen. 25.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Rebecca could not be contented without chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18422:95"/>
and yet when ſhee had conceived, and the children began to ſtrive in her wombe,</hi> ſhee ſaid, <hi>if it be ſo, why am I thus?</hi> So it is with a proud diſcontented heart. Hee muſt have this, and hee will have that, and if there be any weakneſſe, hee ſinks downe in his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſh. 7.7.</note>It is a ſtrange paſſage of good <hi>Ioſuah:</hi> when the Lord had diſcomfited the hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> ſee how he complaines, ſaying, <hi>Alas, (oh Lord God) wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over</hi> Iordan, <hi>to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, would God we had beene content to dwell on the other ſide Iordan.</hi> As if hee had not begged Gods bleſſing, and had not ſeene Gods hand in ſuccouring of him before, and yet now becauſe hee had not what he would, hee takes all in the worſt ſence. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, when the Lord had call'd him to goe before <hi>Pharaoh, ſend by whom thou ſhould'ſt ſend.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 4.13.</note> As if God muſt not diſpoſe of him, becauſe he had not that eloquence which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, as he quarrells with his condition, ſo hee becomes weary of his life, and will needs dye in a pet, becauſe God anſwers not, and his humour is not fitted, therefore hee will away from the world, no man ſhall ſee him any more, neither will he ſee any man. Thus it was with good <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he ſaid,<note place="margin">1 King. 19.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord take away my life, for I am no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my Fathers.</hi> So it was with <hi>Ionah,</hi> and with <hi>Iob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 3.10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>You women thinke of this.</hi> It may be your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands will not ſpeake to you as you would have

them, and then you wiſh; Oh, that you had dyed in ſuch a ſickneſſe, &amp;c. Downe with thoſe proud hearts. The Lord hath given you life, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it, that you may ſeeke to God, and yet you will needs dye in a ſullen fit: its mercy that you may live to ſeeke mercy.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in concluſion, when the Soule hath thus quarrelled with God, and ſlighted all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and quarrelled with his condition, and is grown weary of his life &amp; all, then the Soul comes to a deſperate diſtraction in himſelfe, and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thought ſeazeth upon the Soule of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented man, that his heart is almoſt driven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond himſelfe, and out of this comes a great deale of madneſſe in the wicked, and it doth much hurt to the good too. His thoughts run in a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hurry one upon another, and makes the Soule unfit to doe any good to others, or to receive any good from others. Here is the cauſe: when God hath opened your eyes, and the wrath of God firſt began to purſue you, then you could have been content to fall into a river, and to make away your ſelves; Now, what if God will have you beare his hand, and will not give you grace yet, why doe you quarrell againſt God? Oh, ſit downe and humble your ſelves with meekeneſſe, and calmneſſe, and wonder that you are not in hell; what if you had beene damned long agoe? Thus it was with <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhee would not be comforted becauſe her children were not. So it is with thy Soule, thou muſt have what thou wilt, or elſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18422:96"/>
thou wilt not be comforted. Now, there are two objections againſt the former truth, which I muſt remoove and anſwer before I goe any further.</p>

This is the plea of a diſcouraged ſinner, and therefore he thinks he doth well, to ſit downe <hi>Rachel</hi> like, and not to be comforted, but to let his Soule fall in ſorrow.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I confeſſe, it is true. The heart truly humbled ought to be. Nay, it cannot be brought to ſee it ſelfe in every kinde, ſo that it judgeth it ſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the leaſt mercy, and worthy of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt judgements, it cannot but be contented in abaſement; but yet there is a great difference betweene a heart truely humbled, and a diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged heart. And the difference appeares in two things.</p>
               <p>The Soule thinkes he doth marvellous well to be thus diſcouraged, and that there is no other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18422:96"/>
but this. Know therefore this double difference.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene a heart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and a heart diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</note> This Humiliation leaves the Soule more calme and better able to under-goe a light blow when it hath borne this. Whereas after diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement the Soule is more full of trouble, and more unable to beare any trouble, becauſe it hath ſunke under this: If the Lord denies to the humble Soule that which he would have, it makes him more able to beare the want of any thing: but the diſcouraged Soule flyes off, and is leſſe able to beare the hand of God in the want of any thing. Humiliation ſeaſons the veſſell, and makes it more wide, and more fit to hold liquor, but, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement crackes the veſſell, and makes that it will hold nothing at all. And, humiliation is like the Tentures that ſtretcheth the cloath, and makes it more ſmooth and plaine: humiliation ſtretcheth the Soule, and makes it more humble, and meeke: but diſcouragement rends the heart, and makes it more unfit to undergoe that which is laid upon it. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſaith, you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the exhortation which ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.5.</note> 
                  <hi>My Sonne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thou the correction of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> The Word faint, that is, diſcouragement is ſpoken of by our Saviour, When he was mooved with compaſſion towards the people becauſe they fainted,<note place="margin">Matth. 9.36.</note> and were as ſheepe ſcattered abroad having no Shepheard. So I ſay, doe not ſuffer thy ſelfe to be ſo farre ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with theſe troubles, that thy heart be unable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18422:97"/>
to gather up it ſelfe againe. As it is with ſome ſtubborne childe, when his father comes to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, he ſnuffes, and falles into a fwoune with griefe, whereas an other childe is quiet and takes the blow quietly, and goes away contentedly without any manner of fainting. So the heart truly humbled, is like the childe that takes the blow quietly; but the diſcouraged Soule faints, and is not able to beare the hand of God in this kinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond difference.</note>Secondly, the ſecond difference is this. As Humiliation ever leaves the Soule calme and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, after the hand of God hath beene upon it: ſo it makes the Soule more ready, and puts a kinde of abilitie, and cheerefulneſſe in attending upon God in any ſervice, without any hankering after his owne ends, and without this quarrelling, and this drawing backe from the Lord. So, that becauſe hee hath borne the hand of God, therefore it is much more ready that the Lord ſhould diſpoſe of duties, and the ſucceſſe of them, ſeeing it hath found God going out with him heretofore; and he ſaith, the truth is, ſometimes the Lord did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mee that mercy which I deſired, and bleſſed be God for it, for by this meanes I found my proud heart humbled and brought downe; therefore if God will have mee doe any dutie, I will doe it, and if he caſt ſhame and diſgrace upon mee in it, I am contented. This is a heart truly humbled: but, the diſcouraged Soule not receiving that ſtrength and aſſiſtance in his duties that he would have, he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18422:97"/>
is marvellous untoward, and unwilling to come to the like ſervice any more. For feare hee want ſucceſſe, and ſhall not be able to beare the want of it. Humiliation (as it were) levels the heart, that the Lord Ieſus may take place there; but this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement delves the heart, and makes it more unfit for Chriſt. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was ſent to prepare the way for Chriſt, that every valley might be fild, and every mountaine and hill brought low. The high way wherein Chriſt went is the heart, and the ditch or valley, was the deſperate diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged heart, and this fainting of heart unfits the way for Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 3.4.</note> as well as the mountaines and hils. As, Humiliation levels the heart, and makes it fit for Chriſt, ſo this diſcouragement delves and unfits the Soule to be quickned, and to give way to a Saviour, and to entertaine him. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation takes off the knottineſſe of the heart, and makes it runne faſter in the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but diſcouragement hangs a backe byas upon the Soule, that, as a backe byas holds a boole that a man cannot make it run right to the marke: ſo this diſcouragement is like the backe byas, and thats the reaſon why a diſcouraged heart comes ſo awkely to holy duties, as to conference, faſting, and the like. If a man goe to faſting, and prayer privately, if God give him not that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that he would, and he cannot doe it as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; oh, how hardly is he drawne to it againe: but the humbled Soule ſaith, bleſſed be God, though I had not that ſtrength, and that ſucceſſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18422:98"/>
that I deſired, yet if the Lord ſhall call mee to the like dutyes, I will goe againe though I cannot doe as I would. So then, know that there is no ground for discouragement; thats a ſinne: be contented, yet for ever humbled.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> In the next place, the diſcontented perſon thinks his way reaſonable, and it is warrantable for him now and then to bee diſcontented and therefore he ſaith, what would you have a man doe? you know it, and I find it, that God hath denyed mee many abilities in thoſe duties which hee calls for at my hands, others have gifts, and power and abilities, but I am weake and feeble, and can any man, nay, ſhould any man be contented with this: would you have a man content with his ſinne? I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive it, thus, becauſe they ſee ſuch deadneſſe and untowardneſſe of heart therefore they conceive that they doe well to be diſcontented, and they caſt all the fault upon their ſinne.</p>

                  </label> This is a deſperate hinderance to all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore I anſwer it thus. It is true, the Lord allowes it, and warrants it that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be diſpleaſed with thy ſinne, not to bee under the power and rule of it, and the humbled heart is at the diſpoſe of God, nor at the diſpoſe of ſinne, but yet bee wiſe in this caſe. It is one thing for a man to bee diſcontented with his corruption, and its an other thing to be diſcontented with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein he is.</p>
               <p>Thou mayſt (and oughteſt to bee) diſcontented with thy pride and corruption; and with thy unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18422:98"/>
but, take heede that thou be not diſcontented with the weakeneſſe of thy gifts and parts. This is damnable pride; and it is an argument that thou art not content to bee at Gods finding, and this is thy diſeaſe twenty to one.</p>
               <p>Now, that thou mayeſt know whether thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment is for thy corruption, or for thy eſtate and the weakeneſſe of thy parts, I ſhew it thus: he that is diſcontented with his ſinne, will never ſinne in his diſcontentedneſſe. As wee uſe to ſay of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſorrow. If any man looſe a freind and begin to grieve and ſorrow exceſſively, wee uſe to ſay, take heed that you mourne not out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Marke what he replyes; may not a man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his his ſinne? To this I anſwer. Art thou ſorrowfull for ſinne, and wilt thou ſinne deepely in thy ſorrow and reſiſt the good will of the Lord? no, thou haſt loſt a freind, and meanes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou mourneſt.</p>
               <p>This is carnall ſorrow, and in this thou never ſorroweſt for ſinne, he that is ſorrowfull for his ſinne, will not ſinne in his ſorrow, it is for thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that thou art ſo ſorrowfull and discontented. Is it not ſo with thy Soule? that thy heart is toſſed up and downe in a reſtleſſe disquiet, and art thou not out of the command of thy ſelfe? and art thou not hurried up and downe in a confuſed lumber in thy mind becauſe thou art not fit for duties? if it be ſo with thee, then thou doſt ſinne deſperately in thy discontentment.</p>
               <p>It is a rule in warre; If an Army be once ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18422:99"/>
and diſpierced, it will hardly come on againe, becauſe it is put out of ranke and order. So that Soule is diſcontented with his eſtate, that is made unfit for duties, and unweldy in them; that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment which unfits a man to be at Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, it is not the worke of humiliation, but a worke of pride. But it is ſo with thee, thy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment makes thee unable to beare Gods hand, and the want of any thing, and makes thee more unfit for duties, and it is not for ſinne, but for thy weakneſſe in gifts, and for thy condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art poſſeſſed with this pride of heart.</p>
               <p>

If thou wilt know how much pride is in thy heart; then conſider how thy Soule ſtands in regard of the word and truth of God that croſſeth thy beloved luſts, and thoſe corruptions to which thy Soule hath cleaved in the time of thy wretchedneſſe; and in this there are two paſſages.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſee how thy heart behaves it ſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſtrict commands of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the keeneſt reproofes, and the ſharpeſt admonitions that are ſuggeſted into thy heart. See how thy heart is able to beare the reproofe of an enemy, or the admonition of a faithfull Miniſter of God, when he meets with thy darling luſt. When thy heart comes under theſe commands, and theſe reproofes, if thou finde thy heart ſwelling, and bubbling againſt the truth, and thy heart begins to bee angry with the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18422:99"/>
Word, and Miniſter and all, then know this, that certainly ſo much of this as there is in thy heart, ſo much thy Soule wants of Humiliation. Is not this pride that the Soule ſhould lift up it ſelfe againſt the Lord of heaven? and take the way of Gods Word? and when the frothy franticke heart of a man wil beare down the command of God? &amp; let the command of God fall to the ground, rather then let a corruption fall, is not this infinite pride?</p>
               <p>You may take notice of this diſtemper in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paſſages. When the Prophet came to that wicked King <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>Why haſt thou ſought after the Gods of the Heathen,</hi>

                  <hi>which could not deliver their owne people out of thine hand?</hi> then the King ſaid to him, <hi>Art thou made of the Kings counſell? forbeare why ſhouldeſt thou bee ſmitten?</hi> Then the Prophet ſaid, <hi>I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt done this, and haſt not hearkened to my counſell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> was naught, and God did deale with him accordingly: So, when Gods Word doth meete with mens hearts, and luſts, they are mad, and if it were not for ſhame, and feare; they would pull a man from the Pulpit.</p>

               <p>Secondly, as Pride is oppoſite to God himſelfe, ſo it is oppoſite to the covenant of grace, beleive and live; for the truth is, that which wee call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie and the ingredients of it, are pride; as the Apoſtle ſaith.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18422:102"/>
by what Law? by the Law of workes?</hi> no, <hi>but by the Law of faith.</hi> If there be beleeving, then away with carnall reaſoning and with pride.</p>
               <p>Therefore I may ſay by collection, if faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all boaſting, then pride or boaſting oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the covenant of faith. Faith is excluded by this pride of a mans Spirit; and by this ſwelling of heart: and the holy Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Habak. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>the Soule that is lifted up himſelf is not not upright with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,</hi> hee that ſwells and bubles up in his heart and puffes up himſelfe againſt the word of God, hee hath no upright Spirit within him, but the juſt man ſhall live by his faith; above all, ſee that place in <hi>Eſay, hearken to mee all you ſtout hearted ones of the world which are farre from righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 26.12.</note> Let mee ſpeake to all you ſtout hearted men and women that are heere this day; you that ſwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of Chriſt, and will not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Gods ordinances, you are farre from righteouſneſſe. The further you are gone in this ſinne, the further you are from the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God. A ſtout hearted man is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles from righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Drunkards and adulterers are far enough from it, but a proud man is (as it were) 20. hundreth thouſand miles from it; hee is far from the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of faith.</p>
               <p>Faith goes out for all that it hath to an other, it reacheth up to heaven for all, it wants meate and nouriſhment, and therefore it goes to Chriſt for all, and pride onely reſts upon it ſelfe for all;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18422:103"/>
faith gives the glory of all that it hath to another, but pride takes all the glory to its ſelfe. Faith goes to another for ſtrength in what he doth, but pride reſts upon it ſelfe for ſtrength: So that, though all ſinnes hinder the worke of faith, yet, pride hinders it more then any thing. You that thinke it a brave matter to be proud, and you muſt not buckle to the Miniſter, and you muſt doe what you liſt, you are ſtout-hearted men, but you are farre from beleeving men. The more faith, the leſſe pride, and the more pride, the leſſe faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. A proud ſoule is farre from mercy.</note>Thirdly, As pride oppoſeth God himſelfe, and as it oppoſeth the covenant of grace, ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes from the two former, that the proud Soule upon theſe conditions (that it is in) ſhall never receive any grace from the Lord. Set your hearts at reſt for that. You may ſwell, and lift up your ſelves, but if ever you receive the worke of grace, and mercy upon theſe termes, I will bee your bond-man for ever. For, he that is profeſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the grace of God, that gives all; and he that is contrary to the covenant of grace by which all is conveyed, let him ſet his heart at reſt, for ever receiving any mercy. The Lord himſelfe is not able to endure the ſight of a haughty ſpirit, he cannot looke upon him, much leſſe will he live with him. He beholds the proud man a farre off, hee drives a proud man farre from heaven.<note place="margin">Pſal. 138.6.</note> The Lord deales by a proud man, as a man doth that is carried with indignation againſt his enemy, he will
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18422:103"/>
not looke upon him: So it is with the Lord, hee will not be within the ken of a proud man, and if the Lord doe come neere a proud man, woe to him that he doth ſo. The Lord reſiſts the proud. Hee whets all the ſharpeſt arrowes of his vengeance, and ſhuts them all againſt a proud man. You bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts conſider this. The Lord gives grace to the humble, but the proud man muſt be content with his portion, he ſhall be reſiſted, not received, he ſhall be reſiſted, not converted, nor ſaued, nor ſanctified. Hee may bid farewell to all grace, hee ſhall never have it upon thoſe termes: and as God intends no good to him, ſo a proud man comes not within the ſcope of mercy, nor of that redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Ieſus Chriſt hath wrought and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Chriſt came not to call the righteous, that is, them that looke loftily in regard of what they do. You ſtout hearted people, thinke of it. The Lord Chriſt came not to call you. The devill calls, and you may goe to him: but Chriſt came to call and ſave the poore broken hearted ſinners. It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>That hee was annointed of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 61.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to preach the glad tidings of the Goſpell, to whom? to the meeke, &amp;c.</hi> You meekened Soules ſhall heare good newes from heaven. But there is not any one ſillable of one promiſe in all the Goſpel, that any proud ſpirit can conceive to belong unto him. If I could ſeperate all the good from the bad, I would have the good to ſtand by, and heare theſe good newes that I have for them, and if you proud hearts will come in and yeild, they may be yours
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18422:104"/>
too: You that tremble at Gods Word, and are willing to doe what God ſhall command, if there be any ſuch here this day, as I doubt not but there are many, then know, that the Sonne of man came to ſeeke and ſave you; it is good tidings. Nay, in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt are all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedome, and knowledge, and out of this fulneſſe of holineſſe, and happineſſe, he fills all your meeke hearts, and hee will give all grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your neceſſities; here is newes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, life, and comfort from heaven. But to whom is it? Chriſt came to ſeeke, and ſave them that are loſt: that is, them that are loſt in their owne apprehenſion: but the proud man was never loſt in himſelfe. A loſt man in the Wilderneſſe is content to be guided into his right way: but the proud man ſaith, hee will be filthy and faſhionable ſtill, therefore hee was never loſt, and Chriſt never came to ſeeke nor ſave him.<note place="margin">All meanes doe a proud man no good.</note>
               </p>
               <p>All the meanes of Grace that God gives, will never benefit a proud man. So that now, it is as poſſible, nay, more poſſible for heaven and earth to meete together, then for a proud man to come to heaven, except God give him a heart to ſtoope. No man can receive benefit by the word, except he be under the power of it, if the wax be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seale, how can it receive any impreſſion? As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom 6.17.</note> 
                  <hi>They were delivered into the forme of that doctrine propounded.</hi> The forme of the Goſpell tooke place in their hearts. There is no Soule can get any benefit by the Goſpell, but
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18422:104"/>
hee muſt receive what it reveales, and what it commands, hee muſt doe, and what it forbids, he muſt labour to avoyd, but a proud heart is above all meanes, and therefore the word will not, nay, it cannot worke ſavingly on him. As thoſe wicked ones ſaid, <hi>Our tongues are our owne we ought to ſpeake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 11.4.</note>
                  <hi>who is Lord over us.</hi> What reproofe ſhall awe me, ſaith a proud heart, I will be led by my owne luſts. Your owne reaſon leades you, and your owne wills rules you, your owne mindes, and your luſts: and what your hearts will have, they muſt have. You ſtout hearted ones that are reſolved not to yield, nor to come under the grace of God: you will not have your affections framed, nor made more teachable, then, ſeeing you will not bee taught, be for ever deluded, goe your way, and be for ever hardned, and for ever caſt off from the preſence of God, and goe downe to the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit, you will have your owne wills, therefore goe to your owne places, for that's all you can have. You that are the faithfull of God, and know any ſuch, mourne for them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Againe.<note place="margin">4. A proud mans end is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fearfull.</note> The deſtruction of a proud man is both certaine, exceeding heavie, and it is like to be mervailous fearfull. There is nothing to be expected and hoped for, but totall ruine, and that ſuddainly and unconceiveably to every proud ſpirit, that beares up himſelfe againſt the bleſſed God of heaven. Let mee open it thus. A proud man is marked out for Gods Iudgements, and is made (as it were) the white againſt whom all the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18422:105"/>
arrowes of his vengeance are fully bent. When <hi>Amaziah</hi> would needs out bid the Prophet in his advice,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25.15, 16.</note> and ſaid, forbeare, <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou bee ſmitten?</hi> I will forbeare (ſaith the Prophet) but know what ſhall befall thee, <hi>I know the Lord hath purpoſed to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou wilt not hearken to my counſell.</hi> You that are acquainted with your ſtout-hearted husbands, and wives, and friends, and know how your children bandy themſelves againſt the bleſſed truth of Chriſt; goe in ſecret and bemoane their eſtates, and pray for them, that if it be poſſible deſtruction may be prevented: goe in ſecret and ſay, it is my husband, or my wife, or my childe, that yeilds not to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Word, and therefore howſoever we may live a while together, yet I know God hath decreed to deſtroy him and her. Thinke of this with your ſelves you that are proud, and ſay, If I will not be exhorted, then I ſhall be deſtroyed, I cannot avoyd it. Oh, me thinks if every proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would write this upon the palmes of his hands, and upon the teſter of his bed, that he might ſee it whereſoever he goes; how would his heart ſinke within him. When thou goeſt abroad, ſay, for ought I know I ſhal never returne home, God hath decreed to deſtroy me. And when thou lyeſt down think thus, for ought I know I ſhal never riſe more. It is not the word of man, but of the Almightie. When the Lord would (as it were) frame a path for deſtruction, hee ſends a proud heart. If once the Lord intend to deſtroy a People or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he gives them over to pride of heart. <hi>The
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18422:105"/>
ſonnes of Ely did not hearken to the voyce of their father, becauſe the Lord meant to deſtroy them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25.</note> hee gave them over to proud hearts. Nay the proud Soule is not onely the ayme of Gods wrath, but as the Lord determines deſtruction for him; ſo, he brings deſtruction firſt upon him. When the Citizens ſaid, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us,</hi> then the King was wroth, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.4.27.</note> 
                  <hi>bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe mine enemies, and ſlay them before mee, &amp;c.</hi> There was no delay, nor no mitigation of the puniſhment to be granted. Oh thinke of this, all you proud ſpirits. Indeed, the Lord will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all the wicked in the Day of Iudgement, but he will execute even the fierceſt of the Vials of his vengeance againſt a proud man; and when the Lord ſhall ſay, where are thoſe wretches mine enemies? then the Miniſters of God ſhall come in and ſay, this man was a drunkard, and this man an adulterer; Yes (ſaith the Lord) I will plague them anone, but, where are thoſe mine enemies? thoſe ſtout-hearted men and women, that hated to be reformed? let mee ſee thoſe damned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for ever. And for ought I know, God hath a ſtrange indignation in ſtore for them. Nay, it ſhall bee ſo executed upon a proud man, that there ſhall be no reclaiming of it, and God will not be perſwaded to pitty him.<note place="margin">Prov. 1.26, 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall call upon mee</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not finde mee.</hi> So that, it is no wonder though a company of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious wretches have no comfort upon their death
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18422:106"/>
beds, and though a thouſand divels ſeaze upon them, and hurry them downe to hell, its no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſay, cry and call they may, but God will not heare them. Nay, the Lord will laugh at their deſtruction, and mocke when their feare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; It is a griefe for a man to be in miſery, but to be laughed at, that's a plague of all plagues. But, to have mercy rejoyce in the deſtruction of a man, this makes the plague out of meaſure mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay this is falſe doctrine, and this is too ſharpe and too keene. Brethren, we dare doe no other, and wee can doe no leſſe, and you had better heare of it now while you may prevent it then to heare of it, and feele it hereafter when there is no remedy. But, here is the maine wound of our Miniſtery, you will not ſtoope nor yield to our Miniſtery. Wee ſpeake not in wrath and anger (as you imagine) but in mercy, wee now preach againſt a proud heart, that you may be humbled, and finde mercy, and ſo be comforted and ſaved for ever. Therefore take your owne ſhame, and the Lord prevaile with thoſe hearts which word and counſell cannot worke upon. And the Lord now fit you for mercy, that you may receive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from the Lord. That's all the hurt wee wiſh you. Oh, that you would ſo heare of theſe plagues that you might never feele them. The Lord hath an old grudge againſt a proud heart. Goe away you proud hearts, feare and tremble. When you are gone from the congregation, do not ſay, What
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18422:106"/>
if he ſay ſo, we fare well enough yet, and wee ſee none of all theſe judgements, and all this winde ſhakes no corne: no, no, once ſtoope and come in, and take the yoake of Chriſt, and the Lord make it eaſie. Goe in ſecret and reaſon thus, good Lord, have not I onely lifted up my ſelfe againſt man like my ſelfe, but againſt God? and againſt his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? and hath God yet ſhewed mee mercy in ſparing of me? and it is yet mercy that I may bow my body, though I cannot bow my proud heart, oh what mercy is this! You wives, thanke God that yet hee hath ſpared your husbands, and that yet they have breath and being here: pray to God, that they may lay about them for humble hearts, that ſo they may finde mercy againſt the evill day. Our God is very mercifull, but it is no contending with him. Did ever any man provoke the Lord and proſper? Come in therefore, ſhame your ſelves, that the Lord may humble you now, and ſhew mercy to you hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> The laſt Vſe is for exhortation: You ſee the   woe and miſery of a proud ſpirit. What remaines then, onely this. Be exhorted, as you deſire to finde favour with God, and to receive mercy from him, now be content to be at his diſpoſing. Walke in this way, and ayme at this marke, ſtrive hard for it, and put forth the beſt of your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that you may get humble hearts. You muſt not thinke that every lazy wiſh, and every deſire will ſerve the turne, and that it will be enough to ſay, is it ſo that a proud heart is ſo farre from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18422:107"/>
heaven; I would I had an humble heart and ſo forth. You muſt not thinke that God will bring you to heaven before you be aware of it, and that a humble heart will drop into your mouthes. The Saints of God have alwayes had it before they received Chriſt, and thou muſt have it too if ever thou wilt have him, therefore make it a chiefe part of thy daily taske to get it, <hi>And ſuffer not thine eyes to ſleepe, nor thine eye lids to ſlumber, nor the temples of thy head to take any reſt,</hi> before thou haſt this gracious diſpoſition of ſpirit.

               <p>I know one man hath his eye upon the world, and another on his pleaſures, and every man ſaith, what ſhall we eate, and drinke, and wherewith ſhall we be cloathed? but doe not thou ſay, how ſhall I be rich, or honourable, but how ſhall I get this humble heart? What's that to thy Soule, that thou art rich and a reprobate, and that thou art honourable and damned. If thou bee once humbled, then thou art paſt the worſt. It is the choiſeſt good, and the chiefe of thy deſires ſhould be for an humble heart. Now to draw our hearts to this, there are three conſiderations that may be ſeaſonable, and ſerviceable to this end. And they are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:18422:107"/>Firſt, Conſider, that it is poſſible to have an humble heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider the danger if you have it not, I will not give a ruſh for all that you can doe without it, though you live <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider the exceeding benefit that will come by this grace.</p>
               <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">1. Motive.</note> It is poſſible for any Soule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (for ought I know or that he knowes) to get an humble heart. This may be a provocation to us, to ſet upon this dutie. If a man had no hope to get this deſire, he would have no heart to uſe any meanes for it. A man had as good ſit ſtill, as riſe up and fall, as the Proverbe is. But, ſeeing it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, why may not thou, and I, or any man here get an humble heart? and therefore ſeeke to the Lord for it, and ſay, there hath beene many as proud hearts, and as ſtout as mine (though I have beene like a divell for my pride) yet they have had this grace, and therefore (Lord) why may not I have it as well as they? who knowes but God may give mee an humble heart too? though my heart be now ſtout, and ſtubborne, and rebellious, yet Lord, I ſee no command that forbids mee not to expect this mercy, and I ſee no truth that excludes mee, no, the Lord ſaith in his command, humble your ſelves under the mightie hand of God. Yea, the Lord hath appointed meanes for the working of this grace, and hath ever bleſſed thoſe meanes for the good of others, and why not mee Lord? Lord, haſt thou bleſſed theſe meanes to others?
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18422:108"/>
and made them ſtoope and yeild, why wilt thou not bleſſe them to mee too Lord? who knowes but God will doe it for mee, as well as hee hath done it for others?</p>
               <p>Therefore goe thou to God, and ſay, The truth is (Lord) I confeſſe this haughty and this rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart of mine will not come downe, it is not in mans power to pull downe my proud heart: No, it is not in the power of Angels to humble a proud heart, Lord, now take this ſtout heart, and humble it, and doe what thou wilt with it, didſt not thou tame the heart of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that Witch and bloud-ſucker that made the ſtreetes of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to ſwim with blood? didſt not thou humble him? and didſt not thou bring downe the proud heart of that ſturdy Iaylor? and didſt not thou tame the heart of proud perſecuting <hi>Saul?</hi> Didſt not thou make him come creeping in upon his knees? Lord, thus thou haſt done, Lord, humble me too. Thus importune the God of heaven. Nay, preſſe God with his promiſe, and with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement whereby hee hath tyed himſelfe. <hi>The day of the Lord of Hoasts ſhall be upon every one that is lifted up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and that is proud and lofty,</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>and he ſhall be brought low, and upon all the Cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the Oaks of Baſhan.</hi> That is, upon all mighty, vile, ſturdy, and unreaſonable men; and what then? they ſhall be brought full low, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. The day of the Lord ſhall be upon all fleſh; preſſe God with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18422:108"/>
and entreate the Lord to remember it, and ſay, Lord make all thoſe ſturdy hearts yield. Oh that this may be the day, and that I may be the man, and that my heart may be the heart, that thy mercy and grace may onely be admired and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at. Thus you ſee, that God may doe as much for you, as he hath done for others; and it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to get an humble heart, therefore labour for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it is poſſible to get an humble heart,<note place="margin">2. Motive.</note> So, conſider, that if you miſtake your ſelves, and faile here, the danger is wonderfull deſperate, and fearefull, and therfore, uſe ſo much more care and diligence, not to be deceived therein. If you miſſe here, never looke to be ſaved nor recovered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Miſſe now, and you are undone for ever, its as much as your ſoules be worth: as your Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is, ſo your Faith, ſo your Sanctification, and your obedience will be. If that be naught, all will be naught. It is obſerved by Philoſophers, and Phyſicians that if there be any fault in the firſt diſgeſture, it cannot be amended in the next, if the ſtomacke diſgeſt the meate ill, the Liver can never make good blood: So a wound here, can never be amended. If the bottome and foundation of a building, be not ſound and ſubſtantiall, though the frame be never ſo neate and handſome, yet there is no mending of it, it muſt be all puld down, and the ground-worke made more ſure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when men ſet up ſome maine pillars to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a houſe, they digge deepe and low, and ſet them ſtrong: So, if this worke of Humiliation be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18422:109"/>
not deepe and low enough, all the frames of a mans profeſſion will fall downe, there is no mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. If the foundation of the houſe be ſound, though the thatch and ſparres flye of, there is ſome helpe: but if that be naught, the houſe will downe whatſoever the other be: So, many weakeneſſes may be ſuccoured, and the heart may be ſuſtained under them all, if this worke of Humiliation be good, but if a man once prove falſe here, thy faith and obedience will be naught, and the Spirit of God will never dwell in thee, nor quicken thee. See what our bleſſed Saviour ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 7.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraite gate, &amp;c.</hi> This gate, or this entrance into life, is Humiliation of heart. When the Soule is looſened from, and bids farewell to ſinne, and himſelfe, then the gate is opened. And as it is in other wayes; If there be but one way or gate into an houſe, and the traveller miſſeth that gate, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all his labour, and muſt goe backe againe: but if he once get in at this gate he is ſafe enough then. So it is here, There is a moſt narrow way of Gods Commandements, and there is but one way or gate into this happineſſe, it is narrow, and a little gate; and a man muſt be nothing in his owne eyes, and if you miſſe this gate, you looſe all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſhall never come to Salvation. If a man could heare and pray all his dayes, yet, if his heart be not humbled, he and his profeſſion ſhall goe to hell together. In Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the concluſion is very peremptory; when the Diſciples were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending who ſhould be higheſt; Chriſt ſet a childe in the middeſt of them, and ſaid, <hi>Except you become
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18422:109"/>
as little children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 18.3.</note> 
                  <hi>you cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> You may doe any thing with Infants, and all that they have to doe, is to cry. Vnleſſe you have humble hearts, you cannot enter into heaven. Hee doth not ſay, You cannot be great men, or, you cannot goe farre into heaven, but he ſaith, <hi>You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter.</hi> So then, the danger being ſo great, and the miſtaking ſo full of hazard, and ſeeing it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have it, therefore let us uſe all diligence to make this worke ſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Motive.</note> conſider the mervailous good that God hath promiſed, and which hee will beſtow upon all that are truly humbled. And let all theſe be as ſo many cords to draw us to looke for this bleſſed frame of heart. Wee have need of all the motives in the world. I know it is a hard matter for a man to lay downe himſelfe, and his parts and all his priviledges in the duſt; I ſay, it is mervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous irkſome and tedious to the nature of a carnall man; but, it will quit all his coſt in the end. When wee ſhall taſt of thoſe ſweet benefits that come by a humble heart, and have gotten Ieſus Chriſt and mercy from him, then it will never repent us that wee have ſpent ſo many teares, and made ſo many prayers, and uſed ſo many meanes to pull downe the pride of our hearts; Oh brethren, thinke of it. See and conſider the admirable benefits, and the exceeding great good that will come to you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. The good things that come by a heart that is truly humbled, they are ſpecially foure, and with thoſe the truth and ſubſtance of whatſoever the heart can crave and deſire.</p>

                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:18422:110"/>The firſt, benefit of an humble heart, is this, by this meanes wee come to be made capable of all thoſe riches of the treaſure of wiſedome, and grace, and mercy that are in Chriſt: and not onely of the bleſſings for a better life, but of all things in this life ſo farre as they are good for us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee are made capable of all thoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſedome, grace, and mercy that are in Chriſt, and for this cauſe was Chriſt ſent to preach glad tidings to the meeke as you heard before: all the Goſpell, and all the glad tidings of it doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to an humble ſoule. And the Prophet <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Malac. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger to prepare the way before mee, and the Lord whom you ſeeke ſhall ſuddainly come into his Temple. Iohn Baptist</hi> was Chriſts harbenger, and hee made way for Chriſt, and when the way was prepared, Chriſt came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly: <hi>Wee are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) Now, if the heart bee once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and humbled, looke then immediatly for Chriſt. Are you not content to have Chriſt dwell in your hearts? If you will be humbled, and ſo prepared, there is neither want of love, nor ſpeed on his part. This ſhould mervailouſly lift up the heart of every man, to ſeeke for this bleſſed grace. If thou art truly humbled, care not for the love of men, the love of Chriſt will ſatisfie thee. And though thy father and mother caſt thee out of doores, and thy husband tumble thee out of his bed, yet if thou be truly humbled, Chriſt will be in ſtead of father, and husband, and all comforts to thee. God hath but two thrones, &amp; the humble

It is impoſſible that the exaltation &amp; glory of an humble Soule ſhould be hindered by men or devils. Let the devill and all his inſtruments labour to caſt ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon thee; nay, be thy condition never ſo baſe and meane in the worlds account, be thou humbled, and it cannot be hindered, but that the Lord will exalt thee; the Lord hath promiſed it, and thou being as thou ſhouldſt be, the Lord will doe what he hath engaged himſelfe to. The Lord many times for want of this, leaves men of great parts, and gifts in the lirch: they fret and are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved exceedingly, becauſe ſuch a poore man findes acceptance, and is approved of, and yet no man

to be humbled, and to be at Gods diſpoſing in all duties to be done, do not you make too much haſt to goe to heaven, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt will come downe from heaven and dwell in your hearts, hee will ſit, and lye, and walke with you; his grace ſhall refreſh you, and his Wiſedome ſhall direct you, and his Glory ſhall advance you, and as for happineſſe, take no thought for that. Everlaſting happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe, lookes and waites for every humble Soule; Come (ſaith happineſſe) thou that haſt beene vile, and baſe, and meane in thine own eyes, and in the contempt of the world, come and be greateſt in the Kingdome of heaven. Brethren, though I cannot prevaile with your hearts, yet let happineſſe that kneeles downe, and prayes you to take mercy, let that (I ſay) prevaile with you. And anſwer mee now, who would not be humbled? If any man be ſo regardleſſe of his owne good: I have ſomething to ſay to him, that may make his heart ſhake within him. But, who would not have the Lord Ieſus to dwell with him? who would not have the Lord Chriſt by the glory of his grace to honour, and refreſh them? and that he ſhould ſet a crowne of happineſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads? Mee thinkes your hearts ſhould earne for it, and ſay, oh Lord breake my heart, and humble mee, that mercy may be my portion for ever.

more comforted and refreſhed.</p>
               <p>The Lord in his mercy grant it. Let all parents labour to have their children humbled, and every maſter his ſervant. This will give them cheering of heart in that great Day of accounts: when paleneſſe comes upon your faces, and leanneſſe to your cheekes, then I know you would leave your children a good portion, then get their Soules truly humbled. Me thinks it cheeres my heart to conſider of it, if a man could get his own heart, and the hearts of all truely humbled; when he leaves the world, if he could but ſay, my wife is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſuch a child, and ſuch a child, is humbled; how comfortably might he goe away, and ſay, though I go away and leave wife, and children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, poore and meane in the world, yet I leave Chriſt with them. Brethren, though you care not for your ſelves, yet care for your little ones, never leave exhorting of them, never leave praying for them, and for your ſelves too, that you and they may get theſe humble hearts. When you are gone this will bee better for them then all the beaten gold, or all the honours in the world.</p>
               <p>There are many that have heretofore ſtood out againſt the Lord, and they would not come in, nor yeild to the conditions of mercy, all thoſe proud, haughtie, and rebellious ſpirits that have ſtood out againſt Gods Truth, his Word, and Miniſters, and have ſtood out long, ſome twenty, ſome thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſome fortie yeares, let all ſuch feare and tremble, and now reſolve not to ſtand it out any more, but ſince the Lord offers ſo kindly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
